These notes have been collected at great cost by the reformed Black Anvil Mercenary Company. Due to the nature of the Bloody Fist we can only guess at some of the deeper secrets that they hold but the information contained within this document is accurate to the best of our knowledge.

## Motivations for War

While it is easy to think that the Bloody Fist are only motivated by their brutal nature that is far from the truth. Their driving goal is vengeance for the extinction they faced 20 years ago. From the ashes of this defeat their whole society has formed around resentment and hate. The time to resolve this enmity was while this hatred simmered but now it has become a rolling boil. We have found that surrender is not an option for the Bloody Fist. If they are to die it will be in battle. 

We have seen them employ whatever savage tactics they see fit. If they are commanded to capture all women and children from a village until the men submit, then they will. Public executions and necromantic humiliation are common.

We believe that they can be settled with, but terms will be one sided. The Bloody Fist will demand compensation for 20 years of suffering and the deaths of all nobility responsible in the previous war.

## The History of the Bloody Fist


### A Magical Treaty

A magical treaty was signed with the Bloody Fist.  

> Bloody Knuckles Orc Tribe and Duchy of Elysia
>
> On this 14th day of May in the Year 593, let it be known that the Tribe of the Bloody Knuckles agreed to join the United Nations of the Bloody Fist and to follow all provisions of their treaty within the Duchy of Elysia as outlined below:
>
> - All Bloody Knuckles Ore will act nice and not bash any people of the Duke's Tribe
> - None of the Duke's Tribe will bash any Bloody Knuckles Orcs
> - The Duke's Tribe will protect the Bloody Knuckle lands from invading tribes and bashers
> - The Bloody Knuckles Tribe will come to help the Duke bash invaders if the Duke asks nice
> - Bloody Knuckles Ores may come to town and not be bashed if they not have clubs
> - The Duke's Tribe can cross Bloody Knuckle lands as long as they act nice
>
> This treaty is hereby signed by the leader of the Bloody Knuckle Tribe and the lawful representative of His Grace, Duke Azeroth Dragonheart
>
> Chief Grundi Mundi Lord High Boss of the Bloody Knuckles
>
> Thermo
> Seneschal of Elysia
> For Duke Azeroth Dragonheart

#### The Rise of Olzen
Olzen was originally an Oaken Wood Elf. He was cast out by the elves and race changed forcibly to an Orc. He then joined with the Bloody Fist. Originaly the Bloody Fist power structure was very barbaric and nomadic. It mostly relied on numbers and just wanted to smash anyone who opposed them. After Olzen joined the Bloody Fist, it became much more organized and fearsome. Olzen had an artifact, a welders glove with chain mail, that granted him tremendous power in battle. He also bargained with a Fae Prince to augment the strength of both him and the Bloody Fist. 

The Bloody Fist led by Olzen committed heinous crimes against the Oaken Wood Eves. Shamans would try to obliterate the Oaken Wood Elves with formal magic. Olzen could walk the Winding of the Oaken Woods to move his troops this made his army untrackable. The Bloody Fist had 4 generals who he blessed with powers. All of the generals were killed at once with a group led by Henet. Olzen was also slain in a pitched battle. The war lasted about 2 years.

The heroes of Elysia put the remainder of the Bloody Fist to death by a witch hunt level of extermination. The surviving Bloody Fist ran into the darkened forests and hills of eastern Stonewood. 

### The Time Between the Wars

In exile the Bloody Fist tried to adopt a new peaceful way of life but all they knew was war and raiding so this was a doomed venture. Over these 20 years, the burning memory of defeat and exile chewed away at the surviving Bloody Fist Tribe's sanity and will to live.

### The Coming of the Uruk-Hai

A young orc Ahroun makes a bargain with an entity known as "The Black Shadow". This bargain changes the orcs that accept the transformation to be come Uruk-Hai Dragon Orcs that have extensive powers.

### The Taking of Stonewood

Because the heroes of Elysia were not there to defend the city due to issues with the crystal barrier. The Bloody Fist moved in and oppressed Stonewood. The taking of Stonewood was fast and brutal. Anyone that did not accept the Accords of the Fist was put to death. 

#### The Accords of the Fist

The Accords of the Fist were agreed to by the townspeople of Stonewood as part of the parlay with the Bloody Fist Orcs. 

- No weapons on person or drawn
- No spells in hand
- No verbal condemnation of Orcish Might
- Kneel or bow at the Bloody Fist Banners
- Attend the pledge of freedom and tithe nightly

![accords_of_the_fist.jpg](/accords_of_the_fist.jpg)

#### The Pledge of Servitude

Every day at 10 PM the town of Stonewood gathered to pledge allegiance to the Bloody Fist and to offer up their tithe. The Accords of the Fist mandated that the town give an offering every day. This is led by the mayor but if he is away or of infirm health another member of the citizenry performs ceremony. Each of the townspeople that are able  join around a banner of the bloody fist and recite the Pledge of Servitude. 

> *The mighty Bloody Fist is benevolent.*
>
> *The mighty Bloody Fist is kind.*
>
> *The mighty Bloody Fist is gentle.*
>
> *We accept our place below the mighty orc.* **{bow}**
>
> *We offer now our meager tribute though we know it will never be enough.*
>
> *The great orc horde watches over us.*
>
> *The great orc horde protects us.*

## The Changed Ones

This ritual had been gifted to the Bloody Fist Orcs by the Black Shadow. It requires that 6 sacrifices agree to be changed and bound to the altar. The Alter then roars with the flame of their consumed souls powering a terrible transformation. This transformation changes the sacrifices into horrific monsters consumed by their most base desires but bound to the will of those that conducted the ritual.

The Scarifies that were made at the Altar in stonewood are a special lot. Powerful Hoylean wizards were tricked into thinking that they were responding to an auction of magical items but instead it was the fearsome bloody fist. The Bloody fist put them to the sword and only 6 of the close to 30 Hoyleans survived but they survived by submitted to be changed. 

These changed ones assisted the Orcs in taking the city of Stonewood and then patroled it's environs and annihilated anyone that violates the Accords of the Fist.

## The Ritual of the Changed Ones

The Bloody fist kept six dwarves on their knees at swordpoint. They were made to swear loyalty to something called the Black Shadow around a 6 Sided Altar. The dwarves then had each of their eyes catch fire fire. Then they started screaming. They screamed and screamed but they didn't move. Tthey began speaking in unison.

> *Six Clean Souls I offer you.*
>
> *Free from the taint of necromancy and fire.*
>
> *Six Perfect vessels I will gather in return.*
>
> *This bargain shall never be unstruck.*
>
> *These souls are your and these vessels mine.*

Then the screaming started again. That screaming went on for far longer than a dwarf could scream. 

#### The Appointing of a Puppet Mayor

The beloved mayor Stoneaxe was publically executed, a new Mayor Installed. Shaved his beard.

### Occupation of Stonewood

During the occupation the Bloody Fist did not kill or executed since the beginning of the occupation. This past 6 months have been peaceful and almost normal.  A group of adventurers attempted to free the Town of Stonewood 1 year ago alongside Balor Ironleaf using the alias Black Leaf but were ultimately slaughtered and occupation continued.

### Elysia Reclaims Stonewood

## Dragon Orcs

The new Uruk-Hai Bloody Fist Orcs are faster, stronger, smarter, more savage, more tactical, and more organized than traditional Orcs and the Bloody Fist of the last war. They are made this way by the ritual that was gifted by The Black Shadow. This process causes a tremendous amount of pain often killing the changing orc. Even if the orc survives it comes at a great cost. The pain never really stops. Think about how you feel with a a constant ache that never goes away. A headache, a backache a toothache. That shortness of temper and lack of patience. That is what being an Uruk-Hai is like. They just can't think and it makes them furious that others can. Often the behavior that we see from these orcs is visible as a short temper and a lack of ability to focus. Some of the behaviors that we have seen are as follows.

 - Scowling
 - Gruff Speech
 - Cut people off when they are talking
 - Revel in making people uncomfortable
 - Roar when entering into battle

### Makeup

The bloody fist orcs wear facepaint into battle. It is comprised of 3 components. A red tribal design said to be a mixture of human, dwarf, and elf blood. A white decoration on the chin neck and throat. is ground up bone used during that orc's rebirth ritual. Black scales are also present due to the deal they have with The Black Shadow.

## Practices of the Bloody Fist

### Casters Always Travel in Pairs

Uruk-Hai Casters now travel in pairs, always with a Celestial Caster and an Earth Caster in each squadron that is assigned casters.

### The Banner of the Fist

![banner_of_the_fist.jpg](/banner_of_the_fist.jpg)

The banner of the fist is consecrated with the blood of the orcs that bear it into battle. When a great victory is had the most powerful warriors are sacrificed by the shamans and their spirits are imbued in the banners. This is not a punishment of any sort it is a great reward to be with their brothers offering strength forevermore.  Before every meal the orcs give an offering to their fallen brothers by pouring one out at the banner of the fist.

When the Bloody Fist enters battle, the banner of the Bloody Fist is planted in the ground. By channeling the trapped spirit within the banner the warriors within 10 Feet of the banner can receive **The Blessing of the Bloody Fist**. The Bloody Fist are known to defend the Banner fiercely and not be drawn away unless provoked. Tactically they stay near the banner and their Casters but can be provoked with rage or killing blows of their fallen brothers in arms to break ranks sometimes. The banner can be destroyed on a 15 count Counted Action of “I destroy the Banner 1.....”.

**Blessing of the Bloody Fist**: All Bloody Fist Urak-hai within 10 Feet of the Banner.

- Swing an additional 5 damage on weapons.
- Regenerate 20 Body on a 5 Count of “I drink your blood... X”. 
- Rip from binding as per **Rip From Binding** Strong Trait an unlimited number of times.

### The Ritual of the Fire Drakes

![fire_drake_masks.jpg](/fire_drake_masks.jpg)

The Ritual of the Fire Drakes has been gifted by the Black Shadow to the Bloody Fist Orcs. This ritual allows the orcs to summon the Baleful Fire Drakes. These fearsome creatures are green and red Fire Drakes from the Fire Plane. They are morphed into Draconic looking figures because of the influence of the Black Shadow on the ritual. They are incredibly destructive and follow the orders of those who summoned them to complete their task or scorching things. They breathe a fire that will burn anything. They are fast moving and do not speak just grunt and growl.

### Fear of the Black Shadow

It is unknown how this can be performed but we have found as part of the ritual that gives the Uruk-Hai thier power they have a fear of the true form of the Black Shadow.

### War Drums and War Horns

The Bloody Fist are known to use war drums and horns. They believe this inspires both fear and respect. 

## Current Structure of the Bloody Fist

### The Black Shadow

No one has seen or heard the Black Shadow speak but Ahroun when the deal was struck with the Bloody Fist. The full details are only known to Ahroun and the Black Shadow, but not a soul questions the word of Ahroun when he spoke the words of power and granted The Black Shadow's blessing to his fellow Bloody Fist. The rumor is he is a shapeless entity who can appear as an elf in black robes when a deal is struck. The power granted to the Bloody Fist was a form of “Draconic Power” but the true nature of its source remains unknown. 

###   Warlord 

#### Ahroun the Hope-Flayer  (The Warlord)

**Carries Magic Items**

- Blade of The Black Shadow <!-- (+3 2h Sword, Darkness Aura, Destruction Aura)  --> 
- Amulet of the Fist <!-- (Cloak Command x2, Cloak Charm x2, Cloak Curse x1) --> 

*He stands tall like a tree, covered in animal furs and a Wolves head on his, burning orange eyes like the embers of a fire, 2 large blades on his back that could fell Giants, his stare strikes fear in your heart and makes you question what it means to be called a warrior…*

Not much is known about Ahroun's true power. He was once a mere Orc in the Bloody Fist ranks. His father died in his arms as a child during the last war 20 years ago in Stonewood. Once he met the Black Shadow he became empowered and he changed as a person. He went from being a reputable fighter and rising leader to a master of arms and an absolute terror on the battlefield. No one has seen him without his wolf mask in years, his eyes glow an eerie Orange now with the hatred that freely flows through him. Despite this new power and all the hatred that fuels him, he remains relatively calm unless he is challenged or his authority questioned. 

### Generals

The Generals of the bloody fist have been made powerful through a lesser deal with the Black Shadow. They tower above rank and file troops with terrible supernatural strength and endurance. 

#### Gimfang the Skyrender (The Berserker Butcher)

**Carries Magic Items**
- Glaive of the Skyrender  <!-- (+3 Polearm, Death x2) --> 
- Necklace of Destruction<!-- (Destroy x2, Bane Binding x2, Paralysis x1) -->  

*He stands tall but slightly hunched over from years of constant warfare, his muscular structure does not lack despite the change in his posture. His eyes burn like crimson fire, his breath heavy and deep. His teeth almost grinding from the anger he embraces when he smells blood and the scents of battle. His movements are quick and almost panicked as he assumes everyone is a viable target for his massacre. His footsteps leave a loud sound as he stalks slowly. The Berserker carries a mighty glaive and has 2 trusty short swords across his back when quarters are too close to use his glave. His primal roars and grunts shake even the most hardened hearts. His sense of self preservation is low as making the kill is all that matters to this berserker butcher…*

Grimfang was always a violent and angry child. He grew up trying to fight everyone and anything that moved. At a young age he started killing anything that he could with his bare hands for the challenge. He won’t hurt children but anything else with a weapon is a fair target. His glave that he carries is modeled after an Elvish Glaive he used to kill an opposing army general in an honor duel. He took the Glaive and had it reconstructed by Bloody Fist smiths and blessed by the Black Shadow to be empowered. His tactics are cruel and brutal, he will take getting stabbed to make sure he gets the kill. Wounds can be healed but eviscerated foes don’t get back up. He carries 2 short swords for when things get too close quarters for his Glaive, he dances with his Glaive like it’s art form in battle. When the Bloody Fist send Grimfang in, they don’t expect any survivors and they have accepted scorched earth protocol.

#### Val’Kaz the Ruthless  (The Drinker of Fear)

**Carries Magic Items**
- Necklace of Terror  <!-- (Fear x2, Taint Blood x2, Paralysis x1) --> 
- Ring of Ruthlessness  <!-- (Paralysis x2, Imprison x2, Weakness x1)  --> 

*He stands of average Orcish height, a slimmer build than other Bloody Fist. His face half hidden in a cowl, scarred and disfigured from his menacing tactics and explosives over the years. He carries his blackened blade and dagger under his shield for nefarious deeds. When he enters a room he doesn’t speak a word until he has planned to speak. People avoid his eye contact cause he looks directly into your soul and finds what you fear to use against you…*

Some would call him cowardly but he is far from it. He acts from the shadows sending messages and inspiring fear. If you let him know what you are afraid of or what would make you surrender or submit, you might as well consider yourself defeated because he will employ cruel tactics to get it done. Terror is his game and he does it masterfully. His preferred method is for you to come crawling to him on your knees to surrender after he has terrorized you into submission. However, he is not above just slaughtering you and your family and mailing your heads to a mayor to send a message of who you are dealing with.

##### A Warning to Stonewood

Attention vile disruptors of Stonewood,

I Val’kaz the Ruthless, 3rd Blade General of the Bloody Fist, Ahroun's Terror, drinker of fear, smasher of dreams do issue the following warning for your transgressions against the Bloody Fist:

Stonewood shall be surrendered unto the Bloody Fist upon winters end in 3 months. We do not wish to deploy our full tactics and military to remove the invaders to our rightfully claimed land but we shall if you force our hand. Those who wish to be spared our fury may take this brief time to prepare for our arrival and greet us with open arms as we provided safety and protection for the last season before this incident. Those who wish to still remain loyal to the Bloody Fist may do so by swearing it before your mayor Little Bristle. He shall keep tabs on who wishes to live within our good graces and who who wishes to bite the Fist that feeds. 

Those who stay and raise up arms against us know this, we will hunt you like prey, we will rend the flesh from your bones, we will drink your blood from the skulls of the fallen, we will spare no man, woman, dwarf, elf, or child who fights us. The choice is yours, but I Val’Kaz the Ruthless will show you why I am named such if you cross me. You will be turning your head to check the shadows for me when my breed of terror strikes if war is declared upon our arrival. 

Please do think this through carefully, we may sound like bloodthirsty savages but there are darker forces than us that lurk in your Elysia which we will give you shelter from. All we ask in return is your cooperation and loyalty tithes. 

We will see you in 3 months time, I pray you make the correct decision for your own good and the good of Stonewood. The mighty Hopeflayer sends his regards and wishes your families well this winter and that you remember who it was that gave you a second chance where others would not.

~Val’kaz the Ruthless

3rd Blade General of the Bloody Fist

#### Mal-Valoance the Devourer (The Tactician)

**Carries Magic Items**
- Tacticians Bracer <!-- (Arcane Armor 10, Imprison x2, Circle of Power x1, Tarrying x1) -->
- Bulwark of the Battlefield Shield  <!-- (Bane Binding x2, Bane Command x2, Regenerate x1) -->

*He stands tall and proud, his posture very good for an Orc. An eyepatch across his left eye, his right eye is always at the Horizon scanning for movements of enemy troops. His hands are always behind his back with a military-like posture. Well spoken and educated for what one might expect at first look. His movements are sharp and decisive. His peers look at him with respect because he already has planned how to defeat them if they cross him…*

Mal-Valoance from a young age took to studying the tactics of all creatures and races. His eye and acumen on the battlefield are unmatched among his kind. He has a library of tactic and society books to understand his enemies from birth to the grave. His skill in battle is very impressive but his true skill lies in his ability to control the battlefield and the armies clashing on it. He is not afraid to retreat and let them fight a skeleton force to preserve his main army. Living to fight another day and destroying his enemy without drawing a sword is preferred methods but when people see the Bloody Fist terror makes men panic and draw blades.

#### Svoul the Silent Strider (The Face and Dagger)

**Carries Magic Items**
- Blade of Assasination   <!-- (+3 Short Sword, Silence x2) -->
- Necklace of Hidden Movements  <!-- (Sleep x2, Silence x2, Curse x1) -->

*He stands at the ready, quietly composed and eyes darting around the room to make sure of all exits and potential threats. His face hidden mostly by a black mask up to his eyes for stealth, not much of his skin visible so people don’t see his Orcish nature coming for them. He may not seem well armed but that would be a mistake to assume he isn’t loaded to the teeth with weapons and tools of assassination. His eyes reflect the lives he has taken ahead of their time, dead and cold as they stare at yours determining what fate has in store. Obsessively he flips coins when passively determining the fate of people he meets, heads for dead or tails for potential victim…*

A mighty assassin. Nobody knows where he will strike. Svoul was recruited into the Bloody Fist at a young age when his parents were killed by the Bloody Fist during a tribal “misunderstanding.” Fueled with grief and Orcish bloodlust, Svoul focused inward and sharpened his skills into razor precision and deadly efficiency. When things require a delicate touch or political coercion, Svoul is sent in. Mastering the art of subterfuge and etiquette to get him in the door but when it’s time to execute the plan he will make it seem like he was never there and leave a trail of carnage in his wake. Sometimes missions are as simple as black bag and grab a target or setup a murder scene and pin the job on someone else. He uses an assortment of weapons based on the job to make sure it fits the description and wounds match the job to avoid suspicion.

### High Shamans

#### Strum Skyburner (Celestial Avatar of the Sky)

**Carries Magic Items**
- Wand of Skyburner   <!-- (Eldritch Blast x5) -->
- Amulet of Skyburner <!-- (Dragons Breath x3, Shield Magic x2) -->

*He stands slightly hunched from his age but a grizzled veteran of war with the Bloody Fist. A well studied wizard from his time in his library. A completely self taught wizard but very deadly in combat. His face is covered in Celestial markings and runes. He has devoted himself, a rarity among Orcish kind but he is a prodigy or Celestial Magic. The air around him has a lingering scent of magic and fire radiating in it. His robes are Dark Red like the setting Sun when it appears like it is on fire…*

Strum is a very highly intelligent Orc. His theories about magic and turning the very sky into fire are very fascinating and convincing. Most of the Bloody Fist think he is a madman for his ideas of “Sky Magic” but his skill in combat when he unleashes his barrage of elemental attacks is terrifyingly effective so people don’t openly speak out against his “madness” much. He is very willing to converse about magic and magical theories of Celestial and Elemental nature, he has little use for Earth Magic outside of it being used to heal him. His Wand has inspired fear into many foes and nobles over the years. It is made of Bloodstained Bone from a Hippogriff and feathered with rare bird feathers.

#### Nur’gal Bloodbane (Earth Necromancer)

**Carries Magic Items**
- Staff of the Bloodbane  <!-- (Taint Blood x2, Cause Disease x2, Desecrate x1) -->
- Amulet of the Bloodbane <!-- (Cloak Chaos x2, Cause Mortal Wound x2, Create Undead x1) -->

*He stands with the power of undeath in and around him. His eyes are a white-ish blue like the undead he commands, the lack of pupils is a very sinister feeling when he gazes at you. His bone is covered in scars and markings of Undeath. He has a Chaos Star on his throat, necklace of bones hanging from his neck, and a Skull Staff in his hand ready to kill your friends and resurrect them for his legions without remorse…*

Nur’gal was a very cruel young Orc. He would kill things just to see how they worked as an undead. People distanced themselves from Nur’gal as his necromantic practices got more intense. As for his practices, he was very good and thorough with his research. His newest ritual is to create a new type of Death Knight infused with the Black Shadow's blessing. He is responsible for the current Honor Guard ritual and strength but he isn’t happy with it and thinks he can make it better. If you can be made into a vessel for Undeath, Nur’gal will find a way to make you useful.

#### Uktena Wolvesbane (Earth Spirit Healer)

**Carries Magic Items**
- Wolvesbane Amulet <!-- (Regenerate x2, Cure Mortal Wounds x2, Life x1)  --> 
- Dagger of Wolvesbane  <!-- (Silver Dagger, +1 Damage Aura, Purify Blood x2, Restore Limb x2) --> 

*He stands shorter than your average Orc but very stout in stature. His arms and shoulders are covered in Wolf White fur with streaks of blood across them. His hands are covered with wolf claws as a proper shaman would, used for ritual and rending the flesh of his foes who try to bring harm to the Bloody Fist. His face and neck with the blood of other Orcs smeared on it to link them spiritually. When he walks among the other Fist members, they part the way out of respect for his ability as a healer and trust when he says how to tend to the wounded*

Uktena was brought into the life of being a healer when he saved his older brother during the last Bloody fist was with his last bit of healing magic before passing out. His whole life he spent mending the wounds of the Bloody Fist. From just basic healing arts to purging spirit effects, Uktena devoted his life to spirit healing and the war effort of the Bloody Fist. While he is an impressive healer, he is also very impressive in combat with his claws in defending those who are wounded among the Bloody Fist.

### Honor Guard

Nameless Soldiers, They all give up their names to serve the Bloody Fist. High Shaman and Up are escorted around by them. They follow orders to the letter no exceptions. If the Fist tell them to commit suicide they will fall on their swords. 

### Raid Leaders

You lead the ranks of the Bloody Fist grunts and scouts with terrifying vigor. Your word is law to the lower ranks, they will die on your command. Every battle you win is another reward closer to a promotion to Honor Guard. The Generals and Warlord rely on your tenacity and tactics to win the war against Woodhaven.

 - Gnar the Black Fury
 - Skindancer the Cruel
 - Wendigo the White Howler

### Other Notables

#### Bonesaw the Jailor

**Carries Magic Items**
- Bonesaw <!--  (+3 2H Sword, Confine x2)  --> 

*He stands large and imposing, his black leather executioner hood hides his bloodstained face and wicked grin. His appearance savage and in your face but he has a charm about his evil. Despite his cruel words and tactics, he can still make you laugh and smile. Just before he bashes someone's skull in with his Bonesaw…*

Known for his brutal ways of blood sacrifice. Some don’t care for for his approach but his favor with Ahroun means he cannot be challenged. The warlord favors his methods because they bring results.

##### The Final Comfort

Captives of the Bloody Fist are offered a choice to die or accept the caress of the fist. They should have chosen death. The poor souls that have chosen are then bound and a deadly magic is inflicted upon them. This magic creates terrible creatures from their pain. The creatures are bound to the area nearby the poor captive but are fearsome foes. The Bloody fist get a particular glee from the suffering that this causes.

#### Orcamedies

The spirt of the great orcish inventor that plagued Greyhorn has been captured in a talking skull. He had attempted to join the Bloody Fist but rather than take him in, the Bloody Fist took the only part they needed, his intellect, and flayed the flesh from his bones. Now he provides technical assistance to the Bloody Fist while he plots his death to end this half life. 

##### Ballista

A powerful Ballista made of Stonewood that can fire specially made bolts that can penetrate even the most powerful structure. 

##### Spirit Bomb

A powerful weapon that has been developed in secret. It feeds off the marinated spirits of 10 powerful orc warriors who are allowing themselves to be transferred to a fearsome contraption that will force the will of those orcs upon all those who are within 30 miles of the detonation. The infusion of orcish energy will sway the minds of those who are affected to be sympathetic to the orcish cause. 

##### The Gnawing Ones

During the occupation of the town of Stonewood the Bloody Fist introduced  an invasive wood borne pest that feeds  on the roots of the mighty Stonewood trees that have not yet been .  Sated they  move to a breeding stage digging large caverns in t for their young to live as they grow.

### Troops

#### Scouts

Bloody Fist scouts are the youngest members of the bloody fist war machine.  They often do  not bring to bear the ferocity that one expects from the more seasoned Bloody Fist but rather they are willing to observe and plan. The Scouts will often leave the field of battle without ever engaging with an enemy in battle having gained knowledge to bring back to the horde with none the wiser. 

#### Grunts

Grunts are most common of the members of the Bloody Fist horde. They are fearless and barbaric in their lust for vengeance. They follow a doctorine that has been beaten into them by through rentless drilling.

#### Shamans

Bloody Fist shamans operate as an independent part of the horde. They do not answer to anyone under the rank of Honor Guard.
