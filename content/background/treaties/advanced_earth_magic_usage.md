Never use a sword if you are going to be a scholar. Embrace what your role is and use a dagger like a professional.

I have never seen proof that there is any ill effect on the land from necromancy. It's hogwash. If anything I feel that the use of chaos magic imbues the air with a little something special. 

Often you use necromancy for the love of the game not because it's effective. You are sending a message about the kind of person that your enemies have decided that they want to mess with. 

## Control Undead

is really good. Just control undead them and tell them to stop. Sometimes I make them Kneel. Remember if you are in a public place to make the it a bit more subtle I just tell them to dance or stop and give it to them with my dagger or make a warrior cut them down.

## Desecrate 

Is not a visible effect. Actually there is no way short of hitting to to determine if you have a desecrate up.  I normally keep my arms crossed so if push comes to shove I can do a quick magic desecrate. If I have spell store I keep my desecrate in there so I can't be caught with a necromantic item.  Have that magic armor up and be ready to go add if they start attacking you make the decision if you want to leave it up. Remember even if you take no effect you still call the magic armor. I find that some monsters will not even attempt to target you if they see the coffin corssed arms. Use that to your advantage. 

## Taint Blood

I really like how your victim cannot screm for help but can still beg and plead. I wish it didn't occupy the same level as Shield Magic but with the innovations in magic in recent years where memorization is not needed it's something you can make the decision on in the moment. 

## Create Undead 

Dominate your enemies and have them stay on the ground. when their friends attempt to heal them BAM zombie lunch. If you are killing folks turning them into undead and sending them deep into the woods is a great way to guarantee that resurrection and that their stuff is just lost. I like that it kind of disposes of itself. 

When bargaining with an undead remember that while they have all the time in the world they are often foolish and lack the spark of imagination. Feel free to trick them.
