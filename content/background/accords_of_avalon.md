# Precepts of a Civilized and Cultured Society

It is upon the following precepts of etiquette and culture that the Accords of Avalon have been written and proposed. It is by these precepts and etiquettes that all citizens of Avalon shall abide, to demonstrate universal civility and courtesy. These Accords will be the foundation of the society, culture, laws and proscription of how to ensure faire commerce and war, for all nations who agree to membership of the Concordance of Avalon.

The goal of the Concordance and of these Accords, is the fair and equitable treatment of all civilized races in and a crossed the continent of Avalon. These Accords and the Concordance the ruling body composed of representatives of the Monarchs of all member nations shall endeavor to ensure that the principles and spirit of these Accords are maintained, and that the wording and law of them be enforced diligently and with a hand of justice.

## Foundations of Culture

**Sovereign Monarchy.** The principal, upon which our societies are founded, is that hierarchical order will allow honor, goodness and justice to prevail. Responsibility for decisions on behalf of the people at large must ultimately rest somewhere, and where it rests is upon the sovereign monarch of that land. It is ultimately to the will of the monarch that all legal matters shall be deferred.

These Accords seek not to take away from this sovereign power, but through the mutual consent of the participating rulers, create a legal and social framework in which all nations may interact in order to promote peace, prosperity, commerce and order across Avalon.

The Kingdoms of the Concordance are feudal societies, governed by the oath-sworn nobles who each answer to a liege-lord above him or her. This means that there is a strongly observed hierarchy. Ours is not a system of equality of all people. It is a system of duty to one's superior in return for protection and support. Often though, High-ranking Nobles throughout the lands listen to the commoners, the adventurers, and their nobles about their concerns.

The Sovereign Monarch owns all the lands and properties within their kingdom. The sovereign chooses people to administer the majority of these holdings in his or her name. These people are vassals of the Monarch. Each of these people administers the lands as if they were their own. In return they swear that they will support the Monarch, adhere to the laws of the nation, ensure their nobles compliment the Code of Chivalry, provide troops in time of war, collect taxes, and meet any other duties the Monarch, and Crown, expects of them.

**Nobility.** It is the principal of our culture that the strong should act as the protector and guardian of the weak. That each person has a role that they might fulfill in society, and all roles are equally important. Without the farmers, artisans, smithies, miners, tailors and countless other laborers and craftsmen the raw materials and products necessary for the very existence of society could not be had. Without the nobles, knights, diplomats and countless other noble positions, the laws, justice, safety, order and well being that are the benefits of a society could not be had.

With the power of rank, comes so its responsibilities. Commoners are citizens and have rights under the power of their Sovereign as well. The nobility is empowered with duty because they love the Land and all her people. Each noble owes certain responsibilities to the commoners upon their lands. In return for part of the profits of the commoners' labors, the noble who governs the land is expected to protect them from crime, protect them from invasion, and help them when they are in need. The noble is expected to provide leadership, an example of proper behavior, and to improve the lot of his or her commoners over time.

The commoners' responsibility is to be willing to pay fair taxes, join the militia in time of need, help their nobility administer justice by reporting crimes and providing testimony, defend their nobilities names and address and treat nobles with the respect and the title that they are due. Such respect to the nobility is expected of all people who traverse through the nations of the Concordance of Avalon, be they citizens of this nation or visitors.

## Social Customs

In all civilized lands, there are four basic conventions of good conduct that the people observe. These conventions may even be regarded as law in some nations. One or more of these concepts and social conventions may be held to be of a higher importance in different lands. These are not concepts that are enforced by the Concordance of Avalon. They are however concepts common to all civilized nations, and of import in establishing a fraternity of culture across Avalon.

**Hospitality.** If you invite a person into your home or holdings and they accept your hospitality, they will be treated as a guest, and the members of the household will do their best to protect the guests from any harm. Conversely, the guest has a responsibility not to abuse the goodwill of the host. It is expected that the nobility, in particular, be bound by this ancient tradition. It is of the utmost importance that the principal of hospitality be observed by and for visitors from other nations.

**Oathkeeping.** In the older nations, and in many of the new, it is generally accepted that a person's word is good. Because of this, if a person swears loyalty to another and that oath is accepted, even if they have been enemies, the oath will still be accepted. The person swearing the oath of loyalty will be expected to support and protect their liege, and likewise, the liege is expected to offer the same favor to the vassal. Some cultures will require more than just the giving of a words, however Oaths and Oathkeeping are strong bonds to the civilized races. One is expected to abide loyally and honorably to their sworn word and oaths. Many nations may have local laws that pertain to this.

**Kinship.** The loyalty one feels to their kin should be second only to the loyalty one feels to their kingdom and sovereign ruler. The binding of kinship is a very strong tie. In some lands, the committing of a criminal act is more strictly punished if the victim is your kin. Being called a kinslayer is a strong accusation indeed among most civilized people.

**Personal Honor.** Even among civilized people, many have a very strong sense of personal honor, at least in the sense of defending it against statements and acts of others. In some nations, slights to honor are settled through the ancient practice of Dueling, while other nations prefer to settle disputes through public debate. The regard for life and safety on Avalon is much stronger than it ever has been, with many reluctant to shed blood for the sake of honor alone. The rules of honor and honor combat are not in the jurisdiction of these Accords and may be defined and declared by the local culture and monarch of any Member Nation, so long as the laws, precepts and spirit of these Accords are not violated.

### Culture of the Concordance

**Titles, Nobility and Etiquette.** As noble titles and etiquette have evolved quite differently in the many nations of the Concordance of Avalon, these Accords proscribe a manner of address and etiquette that shall be considered ‘common and polite courtesy’ when dealing with nobles of other nations. Each individual nation may maintain their own manner of address and etiquette within their own courts. However the etiquette of the Concordance shall be considered due and proper respect to all nobles in all member nations of the Concordance. Repeated failure to abide by one noble or one nations nobles will be noted as a measure of disrespect but is not in and of itself grounds for any form of political sanction, war or other hostile action or inaction.

When first addressing any noble, one should bow to that noble in a show of respect and courtesy. This may be a polite bow at the waist or curtsy for ladies if so desired. This need not be falling to one knee or prostration. While in some frontier areas, or in battle, maintaining weapons at ready may be acceptable. However in a civilized and inhabited area, weapons should remain sheathed, the brandishing of weapons while greeting anyone commoner or noble is impolite. Weapons include all manner of weaponry, poisons, or any other item that might be used to induce personal harm.

When addressing a Monarch, their court or their immediate Heir, one should bow to one knee and lower their head in respect and deference. The brandishing of weapons in the presence of a monarch without their expressed permission is quite an unacceptable practice, and may be viewed as an overt sign of disrespect if not an assassination attempt.

Upon the field of battle and war, a polite bow of the head is acceptable as a sign of respect to any noble, including a Monarch. In time of battle one should address all Nobles, Military leaders and even Monarchs by the same address “Sir” or “Dame”, so as not to allow ready identification of rank and file.

When addressing one of higher rank than yourself, you should begin by using their proper form of address and if they are of Duke/Duchess or higher rank, it is quite impolite to speak before being asked to. Individual nobles may ask that those they speak with address them in a more casual capacity.

**Proper Titles.** The following are a list of titles that will be acknowledged and used by the nations of the Concordance of Avalon when interacting between nations. Individual nations may have their own form of address for equivalent classes of people, however the following will be considered polite and proper in all nations of the Concordance.

**Commoners:** The name of a man without any title at all is preceded by "Goodman". A lady would be addressed as Goodwife, Goodlady, Mistress or Ladymiss. In the case of men and women, it is appropriate to use the person's first name rather than their family name I the surname is not known, or if you are more familiar with the person being addressed.

**Commoners with Military Rank:** The military rank of a commoner is always used in place of another common title. Military ranks are usually specific in their form of address, and creativity should not be applied to the address. The military rank generally precedes a person's surname in formal address, but on the battlefield, the rank precedes the person's most commonly used name.

**Commoners of Courtly Station:** Nearly every noble court of the realm has commoners who hold respected Positions such as Sheriff, Magistrate, Guildmaster, Chamberlain, etc. Although noblemen may often hold these positions, in the case of commoners the honorary title of "Lord" for men and "Lady" for women is often conferred. These titles, while noble in origin, do not confer the status of nobility, only great respect. In formal address, the surname of the person is attached to the title. In common conversational address, however, the person's name is not used at all, only the title.

**Squires and Squire Candidates:** Squires are commoners who hold courtly station. Men and woman are addressed formally as, "Good Squire" and then their first name. More conversationally, the word "good" is not applied.

**Titles of Nobility:** The following are the titles of nobility. Persons of lower station should always bow to one of higher status. Noblemen do not commonly observe such rites with persons of lower station, though it may be done.

**Lords and Ladies:** The title of Lord or Lady is often granted by some Nations as a sign of respect or honor. While these titles and what right they afford does not change within the lands of the assignment, they have no meaning to the Concordance of Avalon.

**Knights:** The conference of knighthood is always an indication that the person earned the title personally, and it is not an honorary title. Knights are commonly addressed by title and first name, but sometimes the preferred name is used. Men are addressed as "Sir" and ladies are addressed as "Dame." In formal situations, the full title of knighthood, such as Knight Protector, Knight Champion, etc. is used.

**Barons and Baronesses:** Barons and Baronesses may choose to be addressed by either their first or last name. Use of the last name is more formal, however, and should always be used when in doubt. Barons and Baronesses who gained their title through marriage should be addressed by their family name, indicating that is the source of the title. The titles of "His Excellency" and "Her Excellency" are used for Barons, Viscounts, and Counts. In formal situations, the titles of Excellency and Baron are both used. Conversationally, these gentle persons should always be addressed as, "Your Excellency," or "My Lord Baron," or "My Lady Baroness." For the members of their personal households, "My Lord" and "My Lady" may be used, but only in private conversation.

Nobles of higher station and other Barons and Viscounts will not use the term, "Your Excellency" when addressing one of lower or equal station, but will address the person as, "My Lord Baron," or "My Lady Baroness."

**Viscount and Viscountess:** These titles are most often honorary titles. These titles are not acknowledged within the Concordance of Avalon. However additional title may be acknowledged. If a Viscount is also a Knight, they will be addressed as their knightly status would indicate. It is not uncommon that a consort to another noble, or Regent to another noble might also be given the title of Viscount. In which case if they were being addressed as the representative of another noble, or the Regent to another noble they would be afforded all the respect and title due to their liege.

**Count and Countess:** Counts and Countesses may choose to be addressed by either their first or last name. Use of the last name is more formal, however, and should always be used when in doubt. Counts and Countesses who gained their title through marriage should be addressed by their family name, indicating that is the source of the title. The titles of "His Excellency" and "Her Excellency" are used for Barons, Viscounts, and Counts. In formal situations, the titles of Excellency and Count are both used. Conversationally, these gentlepersons should always be addressed as, "Your Excellency," or "My Lord Count," or "My Lady Countess." For the members of their personal households, "My Lord" and "My Lady" may be used, but only in private conversation.

Nobles of higher station and other Counts will not use the term, "Your Excellency" when addressing one of lower or equal station, but will address the person as, "My Lord Count," or "My Lady Countess."

**Duke and Duchess:** Dukes and Duchesses may choose to be addressed by either their first or last name. Use of the last name is more formal, however, and should always be used when in doubt. Dukes and Duchesses who gained their title through marriage should be addressed by their family name, indicating that is the source of the title. The titles of "His Grace" and "Her Grace" are used for Dukes. In formal situations, the titles of Grace and Duke are both used. Conversationally, these gentlepersons should always be addressed as, "Your Grace," or "My liege." The terms, "My Lord Duke" and "My Lady Duchess" are not appropriate in any situation and are simply not used. For the members of their personal households, "My Lord" and "My Lady" may be used, but only in private conversation, and even then, "My liege" is truly more appropriate.

Nobles of higher station and other Dukes will commonly use the term, "Your Grace" when addressing one of lower or equal station.

**Princes and Princesses:** Princes and Princesses are almost always addressed by their last name. Princes and Princesses who gained their title through marriage are sometimes addressed less formally through use of their first name. The titles of "His Highness" and "Her Highness" are used for Princes and Princesses. All situations involving Princes and Princesses are formal, and the titles of Highness and Prince are both used at all times. In audience, Princes and Princesses are always addressed as, "Your Highness." The terms, "My Lord Prince" and "My

Lady Princess" are not appropriate in any situation and are simply not used. For the members of their personal households, "My Lord, "My Lady," and "My liege" may be used, but only in private conversation, and even then, "Your Highness" is truly more appropriate.

His Majesty the King may use whatever form of address he chooses with any noble of the kingdom. The other Princes of the realm will commonly use the term, "Your Highness" when addressing one of equal station.

**Sovereign Monarch:** The Sovereign Monarch of each nation of the Concordance of Avalon shall be addressed by whatever title they deem appropriate. When one does not know the form of address by which one should address a Sovereign Monarch, “Your Majesty” “Your Royal Majesty” and “King” should all be acceptable address until such time as one may discover the address that the Monarch desires.

The taking of the life of a citizen of another Nation shall be avoided at all costs, and whenever possible, shall be taken alive as Prisoners of War.

All Prisoners of War shall be held in fair and humane detention until such time as the War has ended, at which time all said prisoners shall be released to their home Nation.

If any Prisoner of War stands accused of a crime against the Accords of Avalon, their trial and punishment shall be withheld until the end of military action, and they shall be tried normally, as proscribed by these Accords.

All of the Laws, Precepts and Treaties set forth by these Accords shall stand inviolate, regardless of any state of War or Martial Action. In no way shall a Nations Marshall Law override the power of these Accords.

A Tribunal of War shall be established that will oversee and arbitrate all military actions by or between member Nations and their allies.

All Military Action by one Nation signed under these Accords upon another Nation signed under these Accords shall be enacted in the following stages:

**1.**   A Declaration of War shall be made, this shall include the grievance that has instigated the war, and what reparations the declaring party seeks. Likewise this shall include a writ of alliance from all nations, be they signed to these Accords or not, that intend to ally on the part of the Declaring Nation in this war.

**2.**   The Nation upon whom War is being declared shall write an Acceptance of Declaration, which will include an acknowledgement or denial of said grievances. It shall also contain a writ of alliances from all nations, be they signed to these Accords or not, that intend to ally on the part of the Declaring Nation in this war. Such Acceptance must be submitted within 30 days or else the Nation shall invite the severe reprimand of the member Nations of the Accords.

**3.**   Negotiation shall be had between the two Nations with arbitrators assigned by the Tribunal of War. During this, the two parties shall seek to accommodate all grievances without military action.

**4.**   If it is decided that no mutually equitable resolution is possible, the war shall be planned with aid from the arbitrators.

**5.**   War shall be had, and no military action shall be taken by or upon any Nation that is not included in the Declaration of War or the Acceptance of Declaration. Nor shall any battles, military action, or movement be had upon the land of any other Nations, nor shall the citizens, commerce or any other member of function of any other Nation be hindered or inconvienced by said War.

**6.**   If any of these steps, or any of the other Laws or Precepts of the Accords of Avalon are violated by any party involved in the war, or by any party that not involved in the war on behalf of one of the signed Nations, then that Nation shall be reprimanded severely as seen fit by a council of representatives of the member Nations.

**7.**   If military action is needed to be had upon any Member Nation of the Accords of Avalon for severe infraction or violation of these Accords, a joint military force of all the other members shall be formed and shall carry out this action.

**8.**   In such cases where a Member Nation of the Concordance has declared war upon another Member Nation, the process of declaration and arbitration has been undertaken and the military action carried out, that nation which has lost the war has lost the grievance and must make reparations as defined during arbitration to the victorious nation.

In times where nations, entities and people not signed to these Accords should enact war or military action upon a Member Nation, that nation may request military assistance from any other nation. A denial of said assistance is only permissible if the requested nation itself is involved in military actions and removal of its troops from said actions would put that nation at a great disadvantage. The Council of the Accords shall form a Tribunal of War to monitor such requests and ensure compliance with the intent of the Treaties and Accords for Times of War as defined above.
