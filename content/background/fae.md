The NERO Fae and Cursed handbook was written by Noah Mason and Clinton Snyder based off the previous works of Dr. Mathew Sims for Joseph Valenti. It is intended to be used in conjunction with the NERO Rule Book and the Tyrran Cosmology. Please be sure to read these other books in the NERO LARP game world of Tyrra.

## Introduction

The Faerie are a group of races all originating in a plane which borders directly on the plane of Tyrra and makes numerous direct connections to Tyrra itself. All Fae are immune to sleep and charm, they are all highly susceptible to the touch of cold iron (which are normal weapons), extremely resistant to magic and silver weapons and have no metabalism. All Fae view time as a whole instead of a segmented thing, this unique vision of the past and future makes them all immune to any effects which alter memory. Another thing all of Faerie have in common is the belief that freedom of choice, expression and personal desire are among the paramount matters of existence.

Legend has it that Fae killed on Tyrra do not suffer the effects of death, that is untrue. However, as extra-planar creatures they will disappear when they reach 0 body and return to their plane without dying. However if a killing blow is delivered or another effect that would cause them to go into their death count they will disappear and return to their home plane to resurrect which is just as damaging to their spirit as a resurrection is to a Tyrran spirit.

The vengeance of a Fae who died on Tyrra is said to be truly spectacular. In addition, the Fae are immortal in the sense that they do not age and will never die of natural causes, however they can be killed. Their plane of origin has many names, most often called Tir-Nan-Og, though this is a misnomer, referring actually to the central region of their plane. Their plane has many separate regions each of which is claimed by one or more type of Fae or individual Courts. Most properly the plane is referred to as Faerie or Arcadia.

## The Coming of the Folke

From their hidden world called Faerie they came in great ships which sailed across the ocean and the Veil of Tyrra which holds Faerie apart from our world. The ships were sailed by the Formoire who stood high among the Fae as observers and explorers. Having seen all there was for them to see in Faerie, within the Wood, and the Haunted Wood, and the vast plains of Tir-Nan-Og, Tir-Tairnigiri, Tir-Samhraidh, and Magh Da Cheo, on the islands Hy Brasil and Hy Falga, in the twists and turns of the Maze of Convolutions and in all the hidden glens and dales and worlds of Fae, they turned their vision outward across the Great Ocean and to other worlds.

Tyrra was just one such world they landed upon, for Faerie visited many worlds, but when they came they brought their ways to Tyrra and changed her for all time to come. Many say that the elves were born of the Fae and grew as children of Tyrra rather than of Tir-Nan-Og. But these are legends and were never founded in fact, they were simply stories of old.

When the Fae had spent some time upon this world they saw the plethora of life that came and would yet come and they chose to remain on this world, in part to see what was to come. Involving themselves in the dealings of mortal man for mortal men amused them and gave them a change from the dealings of their immortality. The Fae, ever frivolous and ever living in the moment, saw the mortals who looked ahead to the future, and the end they saw there, as a completely foreign beast. Like animals in a zoo or trained creatures doing tricks for their amusement, the Fae chose to deal with the mortals of Tyrra. Their kind calls our world Tir-Nam-Beo, which means land of the living. Some of the Fae were so enraptured with Tyrra that they chose to stay and make their homes here. However it was found that if the Fae did not return to Arcadia and bathe in the ambiance of Faerie's magic, they would lose much of themselves and become mortal. Some of the Fae found ways to bind themselves to the life-force of Tyrra in order to continue their normal existence. These are the earthly Fae, the Dryads and Naiads those who have bound themselves to elements of Tyrra to continue their presence indefinitely. Not all of them chose to stay on Tyrra, for the Dryads still abound in the Wood and Naiads in the Great Ocean and rivers of Arcadia, but many now call Tyrra their home. Other races of Fae interbred with mortal races to form new races which were both of Tyrra and Faerie. These new races were mortal but usually maintained some of the traits of their Fae parents. Still other races remained on Tyrra and became mortal, degenerate races with little resemblance to their Fae brethren.

One of the legends of their name is as follows: They were making their way through an immense forest when they came to its edge and saw humans for the first time. They approached a farm and dealt with its owner, a shrewd and hateful man who tried to trick them out of their treasures. He had called them the Forest Folk for that is where they came from. When he tried to trick them, a Knight among the Fae afflicted him to always speak with a stutter. When he tried to relate the tale to the townsfolk he could no longer pronounce Forest Folk, it kept coming out as Folke, and that is how the Fae came to be called the Folke among mortal man.

After a time, more and more Fae came to Tyrra. For once the way was found, gates were made which could bring them here without the need to sail across the Great Ocean. Different groups of Fae dealt differently with the peoples they encountered, generally based on how they were treated. Some dealt well and some dealt poorly, some tried to claim power or rulership for themselves.

Oberon and Dymphna claimed Kingship and dominion over Tyrra as if it were simply another area of Faerie to be claimed. This is when man struck back and thus began the mistrust and hatred between the Fae and the mortals. To this day one can never be sure which way either the Fae or the mortals will go when they meet.

## The Realms of the Fae

Most of Arcadia is an area of open fields and secluded glens of trees with springs in the center. Here dwell the Satyrs and Nymphs who spend most of their time in sexual frolics. They are for the most part a benign people concerned mostly with pleasures of the flesh. They have been known to involve themselves with the affairs of mortals mostly when they try to seduce them. The three most common areas of Arcadia are: Tir-Nam-Ban, the land of women where the Nymphs dwell; Tir-Nam-Falga, the land of men where the Satyrs dwell; and Magh Mell, the plains of pleasure which lies between Tir-Nam-Ban and Tir-Nan-Falga and is where Satyrs and Nymphs meet for their congress each day and night.

The central region of the plane has several rivers running through it which divide the land. These central regions consist of several separate regions. Tir-Nan-Og, the land of youth, which brings forth all life to their realm. The young races of Faerie dwell here including, but not limited to: Pooka and Quicklings.

Tir-Tairnigiri is the land of promise, herein dwell those Fae who deal with mortal man and hold that which they covet, including but not limited to Leprechauns, Clauricauns, and Gnomes. It is from this land that the legends of promise and honesty were born and still hold true today. Because of this land and its legends, no Fae will ever tell a lie and will always hold true to their promises. For if a Fae is to break a promise parts of Arcadia will simply vanish. Their home is very precious to them and they would not dare lose it simply because they didn't want to uphold a bargain. Don't let this fool you though, just because they will not lie does not mean that they will not also twist their words and make their deals and promises extremely ambiguous. A truth never told is not a lie and a promise without a time frame is not a broken one.

Tir-Samhraidh is the land of eternal summer, the Fae who live here do so for the pleasures of life and enjoyment of the moment, these include but are not limited to Sprites, Pooka, and Gan-Ceann.

Magh Da Cheo is the land of mists. Few who enter return with more than tales of being lost and lucky enough to find their way out again. A very few have told tales of a wondrous palace within the mists which contains beauty and treasures beyond the dreams of mortal man.

Toward the edges of the realm are the regions known as The Wood, The Haunted Wood, The Maze of Convolutions, and Formoire. Each of these regions are claimed by a different type or group of Fae.

The Wood is ruled by the Lady of The Forest and is filled with Dryads, Treants and Sylphs. Often Sprites will make their homes here as well and many magical animals such as Unicorns abound. The Wood is a airy glorious place where all life grows and prospers. Within the Wood is also found the Faeries known as the Sidhe, they are a mysterious creature who resemble the elves of Tyrra in many ways. Many say that in the very center of the Wood stands the Tree of Life from which all plant life came but no mortal has been lucky enough to be a first hand witnesses of this.

The Haunted Wood on the other hand is a dark and ominous place where the trees are half dead and the court of the Dark Fae roam. It is ruled by the Lord of The Haunted Wood and its denizens are, but not limited to, Dark Pooka, Dead Trees, and Dark Unicorns. Many of the afflicted spirits are found haunting the wood and when they emerge to Tyrra, they bring distress, fear, and death. Also within the Haunted Wood are found the Firbolg. It is said that in the center of the Haunted Wood, the Lord of the Haunted Wood has constructed a dread fortress named Dun Scaith, the fortress of shadows, which guards the Desolate Pool, the source of all corruption on Arcadia.

The Maze of Convolutions is built within a series of foothills in the Fomoirian Mountains. It is the dwelling of the Dark Goblins, Gremlins, and the Boggles. Often mortals find themselves trapped in this labyrinthine which winds through and under Faerie. Legend holds that any children taken by the Dark Goblins are brought here to be used as slaves to further build the Maze, and that if the child’s parents want it safely returned one must risk the perils of the Maze and find the child within a day of its taking. Mortals who find their way to Faerie and wander into the Dark Goblin's domain are trapped and tortured in a maze that is ever changing and intertwining. Few have made it out of the Convolutions to tell of their experiences.

On the shores of the Great Ocean lies the Mountains of Formoire. Herein are found the Formoire and their creatures. The Formoire content themselves with watching the actions of others and rarely involve themselves in the doings of the Fae. The Mountains of Formoire are a desolate range forming the borders of the plane of Fae where it meets the Great Ocean. Only the Formoire themselves dare its peaks for they are dangerous and inhabited by strange and fearsome beasts which are often unique having been warped by the magic of Faerie.

The Great Ocean surrounds all of Fae and within its waters are found the Naiads, Nixies, Merrows, Undines and Selkies. The Naiads also inhabit the waters found through the Realms of Fae. The Great Ocean crosses the Veil of Tyrra and connects to the World of Tyrra. The Naiads call their home Tir-Fo-Thuinn which means land under the waves.

Off the shores of Faerie are two islands; Hy Brasil and Hy Falga. Hy Brasil is a neutral place where the rulers of Fae meet to discuss all matters great and small. This is the one place where all enmity is suspended and all the Courts can meet without fear of battle. Hy Flaga is where the races of man that left Tyrra to dwell in Faerie live. It is an island of battlefields where the warrior races brought to Faerie for amusement can fight in perpetuity.

The Realm of Fae is conceptual in nature, often new unexplored or previously unknown areas simply appear, the boundaries of Faerie are fluid and accommodate such changes. Some areas are never reachable from certain areas of Tyrra. Some areas of Arcadia are reachable from multiple areas of Tyrra but each area will only lead to one Kingdom within Arcadia so each area of Tyrra will deal with a different Court.

The Realm of Faerie is not a hospitable place for those not native to it. There are many violations of the natural order of things. Included in these are:

1. Alchemical substances do not work in the realm of Faerie, though this means little to nothing to Fae who are unaffected by poisons due to their lack of a metabalism.

2. Cold Iron, or normal weapons, is a substance not native to the Realm of Faerie and all denizens will detect its presence, thus knowing who is wielding or carrying these weapons.
3. The connections between areas in the Realm of Faerie is tenuous and incomplete at best. Travel in Faerie is by walking "The Path." The Path appears to be a road that leads from one place to another, however, it meanders somewhat randomly through all the Realms of Faerie. A denizen of Faerie can control the destination of the path thus going where they choose quickly, those from off plane are at the mercy of the twists and turns of the path. If one leaves the path it can disappear completely leaving them stranded in a strange area of Faerie. In fact often a mortal who is in Faerie will go to sleep in one location and wake up in a completely different one, sometimes even falling out of Faerie back into the mortal world.
4. Water runs backward in Faerie and drinking it can have strange effects (see Food and Drink of The Fae).
5. The flow of time in Faerie is unrelated to the flow of time on Tyrra. Most often days, months, or even years spent in Faerie translate to moments or hours in Tyrra, but at times the reverse is true and moments spent on Faerie can be years on Tyrra.
6. Distance and direction are relatively meaningless concepts in Faerie. The sun does not necessarily rise in the same place each morning. Travel between two points does not always take the same amount of time. Maps of Faerie tend to indicate relative locations of the areas known to exist but give no distances or compass points. Since new areas appear and old areas vanish seemingly at random, maps are of low value and are highly inaccurate. However finding ones way through the Realm of Faerie does seem to be easier with a map. Belief in an existing path or destination seems to aid the traveler in finding their way.
7. Trees are protected by a great enchantment. If a tree is struck with an axe or other cutting implement the one who strikes it will take 100 points of Arcane damage.
8. Certain structures are built by promises, and if the promise is broken, the structure simply vanishes.

## The Connections Between Faerie and Tyrra

There are many ways to travel between the world of Tyrra and the Realm of Fae and there are many ways in which the Fae spread their influence to Tyrra. The original passage from Faerie to Tyrra was when the Formoire sailed across the Great Ocean and crossed the Veil of Tyrra. They brought many of the Fae with them and some of these settled on Tyrra. Those that settled had two choices, they could become Earthly Fae and live here on Tyrra forevermore, or they could bring parts of the Fae Realm to Tyrra. Both choices were taken and many denizens of the Realm of Fae became permanent residents of Tyrra, included in these are Unicorns and Dryads.

Those who did not wish to tie themselves to Tyrra found ways to pinch off bits of the Realm of Fae and place them within Fae rings or under hills. These became Fae cemetery grounds within Tyrra and were no longer directly connected to Fae. All the laws of Fae apply within Faerie Rings. In addition Cold Iron and Copper may be excluded from Faerie Rings but may be recognized in similar to a Circle of Power. Half-Ogres within these areas will lose some of their connection with Tyrra but will hear the laughter of children and the beating of many tiny wings. Entry into these areas of Fae on Tyrra is governed by its inhabitants, both living and dead, only the dwellers within a hill may open the doors and let Tyrrans in.

Fae may choose to resurrect in a Faerie Circle as if it were an Permanent Earth Circle, or they can return to Faerie to resurrect there. Often times when you enter Fae circles the area is much larger than it appears on a map. This is because a large portion of the area exists as if it were the Realm of Fae itself. These are often known as enchanted woods. The borders these areas hold to the laws of Tyrra but as one goes deeper and deeper into into the hill the cosmology will change more and more toward those of the Fae Realm. Sometimes these areas are just large sections within Faerie that are separate from the rest of the Realm but other times they connect with the entire Realm of Faerie and the path runs through them. In these areas Tyrrans will often get lost and find it difficult to return to their world.

Fae travel between Faerie and Tyrra through Fae Gates and Fae Doors as well. Fae gates are portals from an area of Faerie to an area of Tyrra. There are two kinds of Fae Gates, stationary and random.

A stationary gate leads from a set place on Faerie to a set place on Tyrra. These gates are usually closed. It either takes a special act to open a stationary gate or it will open on its own at a given time. A very few of these gates will open at any time to a given race.

A random gate appears in an area of Faerie and Tyrra at the same time. There is no set pattern to these gates and no set amount of time they will remain open. One may traverse such a gate and find themselves trapped on the other side when the gate closes behind them. Some areas attract random gates and have a higher incidence of their appearance. All gates can be either bi-directional or one way. A one way gate can either allow passage only in one direction or may only allow a given individual to use it in either of the two directions once, meaning they can go from either side through to the other but cannot use the gate to return.

A Fae Door is a gate that has been anchored in a frame and can be moved by the Fae who control it. These doors are normally closed and it takes a specific act or Fae to open them. The destination of these doors can often be changed by the owner.

Most Fae however have the ability to rift themselves across the Veil of Tyrra and travel by sheer desire from Faerie to Tyrra or Tyrra to Faerie. Some can even take a group with them when they do this.

## The Courts and Subtypes of Fae

In the beginning there was no distinction or separation among the Fae kind. They lived as one entity and were happy with their existence under the rule of Oberon and Dymphna the original King and Queen of the Fae.

After many generations Dymphna decided she wished to have a child of her own and not just another of her kind that she called child. Oberon sent his Knights out to find a child since Dymphna could not bear any of her own children.

The Knights returned with a mortal child named Maryrose, later to be known as Titania, who Dymphna loved. As the child aged she became more and more like the denizens of Arcadia. After much thought Oberon trapped Dymphna away in a tree at the very center of Tir-Nan-Og where she was forgotten by all but the most loyal of her subjects. Oberon took Titania as his new bride and Queen but she was displeased with what he had to offer and though she accepted her new position as bride and Queen she vowed to never stand by his side as a lover and thus the Courts were born. Each of the Courts have specific subtypes of Fae that are loyal to the death to serve their courts purpose. The 5 very distinct Courts are: Seelie, Unseelie, Neutral, Dark and Uncourted.

The Fae have their own governments and noble structures, however the Fae as a whole have a partisan nature which Tyrrans see as a political entity. The Fae are now divided among several realms of thought, this division manifests as the Courts. Though most types of Fae will commonly be associated with a specific Court it is not uncommon for them to mingle as members of other courts because they view Court as being a rather new concept.

Most Tyrrans who are familiar with the Fae know of the two major Courts, Seelie and Unseelie. Simply put, tyrrans dub those of the Seelie Court as 'good guys' and those of the Unseelie Court as 'bad guys'. In truth, the simple matter that divided the two groups when Oberon and Dymphna were no longer together reflects upon how they each view matters of freedom.

All Fae believe in the importance of freedom of choice, expression and desire.

The Seelie feel that one's freedom should not impinge upon another, meaning that a Seelie will not place their desires as more important than everyone elses.

The Unseelie disagree and feel that their desires and the desires of their fellows are more important than the desires of others and should always come first.

The Uncourted hold themselves aloof from politics of Faerie, considering themselves outside the realm of politics and the affairs of Fae and mortal alike. With the exception for the Amadan nearly all of the Uncourted just wish to enjoy the beauty of the worlds.

The King of all Fae is named Oberon, though he has had many names throughout history. Though he has jurisdiction over all Fae the Seelie Court are most obedient and loyal to him.

A very similar situation exists with Titania, who has also had many names throughout time. When the separation of King and Queen occurred the Unseelie stayed loyal to her though she can have domain over all Fae kind as well.

The ruler of the Dark Fae is Queen Maeve, sometimes call Mab. Her goal is to one day dethrone Oberon so that she can watch her dark children claim dominance first over Arcadia and then everything else they set their eyes on. Due to their twisted nature the Dark Fae wish the destruction of all who aren't their own kind or marked by their own kind. Some of the Dark Fae have the ability to corrupt other Fae and turn them into pawns.

Among the Neutral Court each subtype has their own objectives, goals and loves however first and foremost their largest goal is to remove Dymphna from her tree prison and reunite the original King and Queen of their kind.

The following is a list of the most common types of Fae that exist among each Court. However, there are many more Fae that exist, some of which still make appearances, though very rarely around mortals, and some of which are long forgotten or dead.

### Neutrals

#### The Fomoire

The Fomoire are a race of three eyed humanoids with the third eye in the center of their forehead. Long ago they attempted a coup to rule all of Faerie but were overthrown by the united forces of Fae. Since then the Fomoire have stayed neutral in the politics of Faerie. They retreated into their mountains and moved outward until they came to the Great Ocean. Here they built ships to sail across it and discovered the Veil of Tyrra as well as the Veils leading to other worlds. When it became apparent that they could use their ships to sail to other worlds, they returned to central Faerie and made offers to the other races to give transport. They bargained with the other races trading the transport to new worlds for political favors and items of power. They have learned that overt leadership has more problems than it is worth but to rule and influence from behind the scenes is true power.

#### Leprechauns

Of all the Fae, the Leprechauns are the most industrious, always plying a trade and earning gold. Classically they are thought of as shoemakers but they have many craftsman skills. All the money they make is put into their pot of gold which they guard zealously. If captured a Leprechaun may be forced to offer a fraction of his wealth for his freedom, but beware, he'll do anything and everything in his power to get it back. It is not a good idea to get a Leprechaun mad at you because their curse is that of the Miser which causes the recipient to lose money each day - money which finds its way into the Leprechaun's Pot of Gold! If you are lucky enough to find and capture a Leprechaun's pot of gold, count yourself among the luckiest as they are bound to offer you a Fae wish to get it back from you.

#### The Trader Folke

The trader folk are a type of Sidhe who at one point long ago learned many of the secrets about the magical ambiance of Faerie. They used this knowledge to alter themselves and their abilities. They still maintain their magical nature but instead of being able to curse those who offend them, they can make temporary enchantments upon others.

There are some limitations to their powers however. The enchantment is always linked to the craft of the trader, a trader folke brewer will enchant his ales so they take effect when they are consumed. A trader folk shoe maker will enchant the feet of others so that any shoes they wear exhibit magical properties. The magical effect is quite random, it is usually beneficial but not always, the negative effects may be annoying but are never directly harmful.

It's important to know that no one can possess two effects by the same profession, they would react negatively and disappear, leaving a curse of magic's wrath in its place.

Since the trader folk sell items of power, all Fae respect them and their neutrality. Even the Firbolg who have a mortal hatred of the Sidhe will look forward to the coming of the trader folke with anticipation and do everything they can to aid them when they need it in hopes of one of their “gifts”. The trader folke are often found in possession of Fae Doors and usually know the location, schedule and activation means of nearby Fae Gates.

#### Gan-Ceann

Gan-Ceann means daydreamer. These are simple Fae who are almost completely harmless. They spend their days in simple contemplation and dreams, seduction being their only other pleasure. The Gan-Ceann can enslave those of the opposite sex, and often will to court them. They can cause others to fall in love with them and can inspire pleasant dreams. They are valued for their ability to cause one to experience an Aisling which is a prophetic quest-dream. Gan-Ceann are never coerced to give an Aisling, they only do so for people who have earned their friendship, trust, lust or love. Gan-Ceann are completely unconcerned with the affairs of the other Fae as long as they leave them and their lovers alone.

### The Uncourted

#### Satyrs and Nymphs

Satyrs and Nymphs are the male and female halves of the same subtype. Despite being the same race, they are physically quite different, with the Nymphs appearing as beautiful human females and the Satyrs as horned elves with goat legs. For the most part these Fae are concerned with only one thing, the pleasures of the body. Their touch has been known to cause desire in even the most puritanical of people.

Satyrs are known to be extremely virile and mating with one by a mortal almost always produces children which are mortal but generally marked in some way by the touch of Fae.

Nymphs conceive as an act of will so the populations are not completely out of control. The Nymphs dwell in Tir Nam Beo (The Land of Women) and the Satyrs in Tir Nam Falga (The Land of Men). However Satyrs and Nymphs are frequently found on the broad plain that lies between the two – called Magh Mell or The Plain of Pleasure.

Satyrs and Nymphs rarely involve themselves in the politics of Faerie, however the few that do, do so with enthusiasm. Some of the Satyrs and Nymphs spy out information and use seduction to ferret out what they want to know. It is said that the Tyrran race of Mystic Wood Elves are descended from the Satyrs when they mated with Wild Elves on Tyrra but there is no proof behind this and to the best of knowledge is mere speculation.

Satyrs and Nymphs are an inherently magical race, who have innate magical abilities the likes of which few races have. This innate power makes it unlikely that any of them will strive to gain skill in any profession and thus have little additional power. There is a hierarchy among the Satyrs and Nymphs which was established long ago. The hierarchy is based on inherent magical power with the Princes and Princesses being the most powerful, followed by Lords and Ladies, Knight and Dames, and Commoners.

It is said that long ago the Satyrs and Nymphs were amused by the human concepts of nobility and copied them in their hierarchy.

#### Naiads

Naiads are Fae that live beneath the Great Ocean as well as in the backwards running rivers and lakes of Faerie. They call their realm Tir Fo Thuinn which means Land Beneath the Waves. All Naiads are female, they mate with other races and all of their offspring are Naiads. Naiads are one of the two races which had members tie themselves to the Tyrran plane to stay there without loosing their immortality.

Thus under the seas of Tyrra great cities of Naiads can be found and many are the sailors who think they are drowning only to find themselves alive in an underwater city fathering Naiad children.

Naiads, living beneath the seas as they do, have little congress with other Fae and hold themselves largely aloof from the politics of Faerie. There are exceptions to these however and there have been several notable Naiads high up in both the Unseelie and Seelie courts. The Naiads have a hierarchy similar to the Nymphs. In addition, like the Nymphs, they have inherent magic powers. The magic of the Naiads though is limited to healing magics and never chaos magics due to their link with water.

#### Gnomes

Gnomes tend to be crusty old men only concerned with their privacy and their gardens. There are very few known female gnomes and when they are found they are coveted by all the males. Gnomes tend to stay out of everyone’s business and expect the same. If you bother a Gnome in his home expect your thumb to turn black as he curses you..

#### Quicklings

Quicklings are small fun-loving, often mischievous humanoid Fae who are marked by lightning jags which are symbolic of their power. The Quicklings are said to be the children of the lightning from Faerie and they do indeed share its nature. They are fast, loud, and shocking. It does not pay to get on the bad side of a Quickling for they are quick to anger and rarely hold their hand once their temper flares. All that said, the Quicklings really don't concern themselves too much with the other Fae except as the victims of their jokes which they in turn take out on the mortals of Tyrra in the form of “games”. A Quickling who rises in power and learns the skills of battle, magic, or stealth is referred to as a Quicklord and holds the respect of all of his fellows.

#### Brownies

Brownies are a relatively benign Fae. Whether or not a Brownie is considered good or bad generally depends on how they act towards those they deal with on a regular basis. For a Brownie or even groups of Brownies attach themselves to individuals or places and try to "be helpful” or “playful”. In some cases this works out well, such as the Brownie in the shoemakers shop who cleans up the work area after the shop is closed. But in other cases this does not work out such as the Brownie in the restaurant who decides the chef's recipes are too bland and adds spices to everything. Since the Brownies tend to follow an individual or stay in a given area they do not think about the greater scope of Faerie.

#### Wind Wyrds

Wind Wyrds are free spirits and guardians who contain the power of the wind to keep those they wish away from them at bay. They have no real purpose other than to move about on the breeze and act as they wish. Politics doesn't generally concern them as they are ever moving free spirits. Often a powerful Fae will have one or more Wind Wyrds that they have anchored as bodyguards, despite their relatively weak stature their unceasing ability to draw on the power of the wind is a great asset for a bodyguard.

#### Clauricaunes

Clauricaunes are relatives of the Leprechauns but instead of being industrious craftsmen all they want to do is drink and drink more. Clauricaunes will typically attach themselves to a bar or wine seller or even a family and steal their alcohol and remain perpetually drunk. All of a Clauricaunes abilities relate to intoxication and its effects. The only way to get rid of a Clauricaune is to capture it in cold iron. This is not an easy thing to do as it is immune to magic and if brought to 0 body will disappear only to reappear the next night. If a Clauricaune is caught in cold iron they will leave and give a wish to those who catch them. However, being the surly drunks they are, they will do their best to pervert the wish.

#### Redcaps

Redcaps are the warriors of the Fae, they possess a love of battle the likes of which is only seen among the truly barbaric races of Tyrra. They are immensely strong and fierce, resistant to damage and all magics of both spell and weapon. Thankfully their resistance to magic makes them difficult to heal which turns them into reasonable enemies. Their low birth rate insures that they will never have enough Redcaps to become a serious threat alone. Redcaps always dance and chant in battle almost as if it were more of a child’s game to them than serious life-threatening combat. They chant in unison when marching and stamp their feet in primitive cadences.

#### Amadan

The Amadan are the watchers, messengers and recorders of Fae. Since the birth of the Fae race the Amadan have been bound to this job. Even the ones who do not wish this job are obligated to do so. Unlike all other Fae the only power they posses is the ability to rift at will. Due to this lack of power they are thought to be the very best at semantics among their kind. They do not involve themselves directly in the matters of the

Fae or mortals unless they can find some great gain in it. As watchers and recorders they will keep everything verbatim to the facts that are present.

However as messengers, unless bribed they will always twist and pervert the message to try to get some gain for themselves or watch the simple chaos unfold among the mortal world.

### The Seelie

#### Sprite

Sprites are small Fae women who live for the joy of flight. They have no other purpose in life but to fly. Many believe they are the ultimate in expression of self desire without intentionally harming the desires of another.

#### Dryads

Dryads are benevolent wood Fae, both male and female though more commonly female, which live in symbiotic harmony with trees. Each Dryad is linked directly to a tree and if their tree is killed so are they. Dryads have two classifications based on the types of trees they inhabit. Those who inhabit the hardwood are the warriors among them and those who inhabit the softwoods are the mages. The nobility inhabit the rarer trees and have traits common to both the warriors and mages. Dryads being directly linked to the earth are incapable of casting celestial magic except for a few rare members of the nobility who learn it as do mortals. This link to the earth also renders them incapable of casting chaos magics. However, the Lord of the Haunted Wood and his minions the Corrupters can corrupt the Dryads and rot them from within allowing them to cast necromancy and giving them a perverse delight in it. It is thought that certain mortals who possess rare magics can do the same thing. The Dryads normally follow the Lady of the Forest and serve as guardians of the trees. The only way to kill a noble Dryad is to destroy its tree. The nobility system of the Dryads is similar to the Satyrs, but somewhat different. The Tree Lord followed by the Tree Prince and then the Knights. Legend states that within the Tree of Life is the Tree-Emperor, Lord of all the Dryads, but this is just a legend and has no factual evidence.

#### Treants

Treants are Faerie trees which have an animate life of their own. They resemble humanoid trees and are powerful guardians of the Wood. They serve the Lady of the Forest directly and thus the Seelie Court. Like Dryads they are directly linked to the earth and incapable of casting chaos magics. Also like Dryads the Lord of the Haunted Wood and the Corrupters can reverse this.

#### Pixies

Pixies are relatives of Sprites and also live to fly, they have however, learned from the harsh examples of reality and are more active in preserving their rights and desires. Their ability to throw magic storms will convince most Unseelie that there are better victims out in the world.

#### Pooka

Pooka are benevolent guardian spirits that take the form of forest animals wreathed in flame, most often a bear, though they can assume the form of any natural creature, to guard or aid an individual or location. Pooka are always concerned with the rights of others and serve the Seelie Court unswervingly. Pooka will most often be seen as guardians to influential members of the Seelie Court, never serving a high office themselves. On occasion Pooka will attach themselves to a mortal at important times in their lives. Whatever a Pooka actually does they will do with an eye toward enjoyment and having fun.

#### Sidhe

The Sidhe are often referred to as High Elves, they are a Fae subtype which closely resembles the elves of Tyrra and are thought to be their progenitors. The Sidhe can be found all across Faerie but are mainly found within the Wood serving the Lady of the Forest. The Sidhe are thought to be one of the primordial Faerie races as they have the most inherent power and the strongest link to the magics of Faerie. Sidhe speak of the concept of the Ambiance of Faerie which is the magic force which make

Faerie different from all other realms. They say that they are linked stronger than any other race to this force and it gives them their power. So strong is their link with the magic forces that they cannot even wield a weapon. The longer that a Sidhe remains within the Ambiance that they study, the more powerful they grow. They see all magic as one and cast earth and celestial magic interchangeably. They can alter the path of magics which hit them either reflecting it back at the caster or sending it at another target altogether. The Sidhe's ability to alter magic also follows in their afflictions. They can lay the affliction of magic's wrath upon another which causes a type of magic to effect the recipient of the curse at double intensity. Once the Firbolg were part of this race, but a King's Curse forever split these two races. The Sidhe are highly represented in the Seelie Court not believing in all things having the rights to do as they please if it does not violate their own rights. The incident with the Firbolg was seen as some of their group trying to impose limits on the group as a whole which is why such harsh consequences occurred.

### The Unseelie

#### Gremlins

Gremlins are small, mischievous, devious, and evil. They are attracted to shiny objects such as coins and jewelry. They will try to disable those who have such objects and take them, most often using innate binding magics. Of course they will leave the bodies where anyone or anything can come along and do anything they wish with them. If annoyed, a Gremlin may afflict an individual so that his food and drink will spoil in his hands. Gremlins are low powered but numerous on Faerie. They are not particularly feared or respected, but tend to attach themselves to the slightly more powerful Dark Goblins.

#### Boggles

Boggles, like Gremlins, are small weak and evil Fae who attach themselves to the hordes of the Dark Goblins. Boggles will attack anything that moves provided there is a large group of them. They do not coordinate their attacks and are easily fought against. Boggles often try to imitate the chants and cadences of the Redcaps thinking that such actions will make them seem more powerful as well. Unfortunately their lack of intelligence prevents them from even doing that well.

#### Firbolg

The Firbolg resemble the Tyrran Drae with several minor differences. Their large height obviously makes them noticeably different than Drae, and they have dark patches of fur all over their body. They were once members of the race of Sidhe but long ago decided that the magic of the stars was superior to the magics of the earth and began to study only how celestial magic impacted upon Faerie and the Ambience. This greatly angered Oberon who ordered an immediate halt to the solitary studies as a counter to the goals of the Sidhe. When they refused to do so, he pronounced a Kings curse upon them. His curse was "Since you choose to be apart from us so shall you be, if the earth is not yours never more shall it be!" All of the group who studied only the stars shook as their skin appeared black as night . All ability to cast earth magic’s disappeared from them and the oneness of magic was no longer theirs. Once his curse was pronounced he cast out the group calling them Firbolg, which translates to men of filth in the Sidhe tongue. When the Firbolg were forced to leave the Wood, they completely gave up their study of the Ambience and migrated away swearing vengeance upon the Sidhe.

Eventually they found their way to the Haunted Wood which was the stronghold of the Dark Fae, here they swore to the Lord of the Haunted Wood and he did what he could to modify their curse. He could not rid them of their curse for no one can remove a curse of Kings, but he could further curse them. He added his own curse of Kings to them "To defy the curse unjustly wrought, to the earth I bind you and to the Haunted Wood, so that you may defend me I allow you to heal." This had the following effects. It allowed them to once again cast earth magic though not as innate magic, they still no longer held earth and celestial as one magic and the ability to re-channel magic changed to the ability to resist it. In addition the part of the affliction "to defy the curse unjustly wrought" had the effect of changing the affliction they could lay upon others. Instead of altering the way they were effected by magic, as with the affliction of magic's wrath, they could now lower a persons ability to cast magic in a limited way somewhat like what was done to them. Since the Firbolg no longer spent all their time embracing the study of the Ambience, they learned other skills and professions, they learned to use weapons and they compensated for their loss of magic. The affliction of the Lord of the Haunted Wood also bound them to the Haunted Wood and the Desolate Pool, which is the source of all corruption in Faerie. This further warped them, turning a grudge and anger into hatred and genocidal impulses. They are now among the most outspoken of the Unseelie, wishing only personal satisfaction and the destruction of the Sidhe.

#### Changelings

The Changelings are not a natural race of Fae but have become regular denizens of the plane due to the nature of being bread by the Dark Goblin Lord and have since bound their race to the Unseelie Court making them full blooded Fae. The Changelings are creatures of powerful magics able to race change at will to take on the appearance of mortals. Thus Changelings are placed in mortal families homes when the Dark Goblins steal their children. Changelings usually grow as mortal children hiding their powers and avoiding detection, they are usually very mischievous but are careful not to let adults suspect that they are anything but basically well behaved normal children. It is when a Changeling reaches adulthood that they start to influence things around them for the benefit of themselves and the Unseelie Court. They tend to work behind the scenes and influence others to do what they want. The Changelings can hide their immunities while disguised as a mortal, however the sound of bells make them uncomfortable and those who know what to look for may find a Changeling this way. In addition, a dispel magic spell will cause them to race change back briefly revealing them for what they truly are, a mockery of mortal life looking more like a gray skinned humanoid than anything else.

#### Selkies

Much like Changelings Selkies change their physical form. However it is not to another humanoid form, they change between what appears to be a human and that of a large seal like creatures. Selkies are creatures much like Naiads that live beneath the Great Ocean as well as in the backwards running rivers and lakes of Faerie. The magic of the Selkies though is limited to healing magics and never chaos magics due to their link with water again much like the Naiads. It is said that they desire the love of humans but fear that most humans would not mate with Fae because of the mistrust that exists between the two races. Because of this they spend their days as the seal creatures and change their form by shedding that skin at night to find a mate.

### The Dark

#### Dark Pooka

Dark Pooka are nearly the exact opposite of the Pooka. They will tie themselves to an individual mortal or location and try and disrupt or destroy all life rather than aid it. They achieve a perverse sort of pleasure from causing others to fail. They will often bind themselves to a powerful Unseelie and serve as his bodyguard.

#### Dark Goblins

The Dark Goblins are a race that few would have problems calling inherently evil. They are greedy and self-serving and live to bring misery to others. They attack in groups from hiding and kill any they can and steal anything they find. One of their favorite activities is to kidnap new born children and replace them either with goblin children to torment the parents or with Changelings so that they can have Unseelie placed among the mortals. A group of Dark Goblins together can open a gate between the Maze of Convolutions and Tyrra to steal children. Thus when they leave behind a goblin child often it is possible to follow them back to the Maze and try and retrieve the stolen child. If a mortal is fast and smart they may be able to recover the stolen child before it is consumed by the goblins, of course the Maze is full of mortals who tried and failed and have either died within the Maze or are still trapped and wandering its corridors and byways. Similar to the goblinoid races of Tyrra, the Dark Goblins are more clever than they are smart. They may come up with a clever scheme to capture someone, but never consider circumstances, options, or alternatives. This is their greatest failing. Also similar to goblinoids, they breed incredibly quickly, Dark Goblin woman often having a litter of ten Dark Goblins a week. The gestation period of a Dark Goblin is four days and the women are fertile once a week. The children mature in one week, but do not mature to the point they can learn any skills other than weapons until they are one year old, few Dark Goblins live that long though. If a Dark Goblin lives past ten years, he reaches the next stage of maturity and gains some powers of Faerie as well as more skills. At this point he is called a Dark Goblin Lord. There are rumors that a Lord who survives fifty years becomes a Dark Goblin King, but there hasn't been a King seen in the Maze as far as any mortal can recall or has survived to speak of.

#### Dark Unicorns

Though considered magical animals they far surpass the intelligence and magical nature of all other magical creatures from Tyrra. They are long lived but only measure their lives in hundreds of years. They are destroyers of everything good and pure by the use of chaos magics. The Lord of the Haunted Wood was their creator and thus dark unicorns take to destruction as they are now born to it. The creation and corruption that The Lord of the Haunted Wood placed upon them has made them full blooded Fae creatures.

#### Dead Trees

The Dead Trees are the Haunted Woods equivalent of Treants. They are the guardians of the Haunted Wood and resemble manlike rotting diseased trees. They are not quite as powerful as Treants as the rot of their wood makes them weaker and more susceptible to damage. In addition they have no forces at their command and they are harmed by healing which is a potent weapon in the hands of those who fight corruption. However their touch withers the limbs of those they strike. Dead Trees are a servant to the Lord of the Haunted Wood and hold no power of their own within the Dark Court.

#### Twig Blights

Twig Blights are tree like creatures of pure evil disposition that have an unending thirst for blood. They are born from seeds found at the center of the Haunted Wood and corrupt everything they touch so as to prevent their victims from escaping until such time as they have had their fill of blood, which coincidentally never occurs.

## Monsters of Faerie

Faerie, like Tyrra, has creatures that are considered dangerous monsters by the inhabitants of the plane. Many of these are very rare and seemingly spun out of pure nightmares. The collective name for these creatures is Monstrosities. All monstrosities are greatly feared by the Fae, they are all immune to sleep, charm, and curse effects as well as Fae afflictions, with the exception of the Kings curse, which are the principle weapons of the Fae. Though the following Monsters and Cursed creatures are denizens of Arcadia, granting them many Fae like abilities and qualities, they themselves are not of Fae blood but instead are Extra-planar creatures or Native Outsiders.

### The Aillen

The Aillen is a fierce fiery humanoid creature that causes all that face him in battle to fall into a deep slumber. It exists to destroy the works of civilization putting its defenders to sleep and then burning all it finds. It is thought that these creatures were from another plane originally and were banished to Faerie where their ability to induce slumber would not allow them to cause nearly as much strife and destruction.

### The Airitech

The Airitech are Faerie equivalents to werewolves. They have two forms, a wolf-like beast form and a humanoid form with lupine traits. They seem to be driven by their hunger for just killed or even still living meat. Like Lycanthropes of Tyrra they require silver weapons to harm, something not commonly found in the Realms of Faerie.

### The Badba

The Badba walk the battlefields of Faerie where the Courts make war upon each other. On Hy Falga when the sun sets the Badba come out and consume the bodies of those who fell in battle, like some sort of ghoul or scavenger they know nothing but their hunger. The smell of the Badba or the touch of their skin is enough to make any sick to the stomach and cease all activity to retch from the stench.

### The Couranach

The Couranach means heart eater, it is a creature similar to the Dullahan but more primal in its actions. Unlike the Dullahan fear is not its weapon. It is strong beyond imagining and it strikes down all that come near it to devour their hearts as they still beat in their chest.

### The Ceinn Iothair

Ceinn Iothair means Hound of Rage. These wild dogs are completely feral and could never be domesticated. They simply wish to attack and rend all living things they find. They are not even concerned with consuming the meat of their kills, they simply kill and move on. Even worse their spittle causes others who fight them to join them in mindless killing. These hounds are not the most dangerous creatures alone, however they attack in large packs and incite others to follow their rage as well.

### The Dullahan

The Dullahan is of all monsters the most feared in Faerie. The very sight of its headless body inspires fear in all. Those it strikes find themselves unable to move until it cuts off their heads taking their power for itself.

## Those Races Which Came from Faerie

It is said that a Fae who leaves Faerie and remains on Tyrra without a binding as the Dryads or Niads have will become mortal. As is the reverse, those who leave Tyrra and live out their mortally intended lives on Arcadia become Fae. It is also said that the children of Fae and mortals will be mortals but be marked as children of the Fae. There are many races which legend claims are degenerate Fae or mortal children of the Fae.

### The Elves

Many say that the elves were born of a group of Sidhe who left Faerie and their study of the Ambience to settle in the woods of Tyrra in shame for the affliction laid upon their former kinsmen, the Firbolg. In the realm of Tyrra the Sidhe lost their immortality but kept an extremely long life. Their time here caused their immunities to charm and sleep to be weakened into the simple ability to resist them. They lost the abilities granted to them by the Ambience of Faerie but learned to use weapons, still not able to use the great weapons that other mortal races used so freely.

### The Drae

Legend holds that when some of the Sidhe left Faerie in shame for their cousins the Firbolg, many among the Firbolg saw this as running from their vengeance and followed. When they came to battle them, the time distortions had caused a great deal of time to pass and they were already the mighty elven nation. So instead of trying to attack them directly, the Firbolg hid underground in Draelonde where cold iron deposits kept the other Fae away from them. These cold iron deposits also cut them off from Faerie even faster, the fur on their skin was shed leaving them looking like black skinned elves. In time even the hatred of the Sidhe and the elves faded from memory, remaining only as a distrust of the surface dwelling elves.

### Cyclops

The Cyclops did not begin with two eyes like the rest of the mortals, but with three as they are descended from the Fomoire. When the Fomoire sailed across the Veil of Tyrra and discovered this world, they left behind a colony when they returned to Faerie to get others. When they returned they found that the members of the colony had lost their immortality and they shunned them as they were no longer Fae. As the years gone by the "Triclops" met and tried to deal with other mortal races, however they were always shunned for their three eyes feared as different and recognized as Fae even though they were now mortal. They met their former people the Formoire and begged them to use their power to aid them, though they were mortal they were still their brethren. The Fomoire saw this and was amused by the mortals plight so they laid an affliction upon them to forever distinguish them from the Fomoire. They came before them and said "You who have the sight of three and wish the sight of two shall forever more be distinguished from Faerie to mortal," and so said the lower two eyes of the Triclops burned as if on fire and forevermore did those eyes close. "Go now said the Fomoire, the mortals cannot fear you for your similarity to us now, go and bother us no more." So the Cyclops moved on and was still shunned as different by the mortals. They now live lonely solitary existences away from both Fae and man.

### Hags

Hags are a humanoid race born of human parents. Though born of normal parents these children who are always women are born deformed and appear wise beyond there years even as babes. These children are often abandoned and generally are scorned by normal people. Hags show many similarities to several of the Fae races. These similarities include an innate ability to work magic. The ability to throw afflictions that are not stopped by spell shields, in this case the affliction are only of weakness and destruction, but the similarities are still there. Many legends claim that Hags are truly the children of the Fae and are switched at birth similar to the goblin children found in cribs. Others claim that these are actually the spawn of an evil Fae with a human mother. Some go so far as to claim that these are the offspring of the Lord of the Haunted Wood himself.

### Sirens

Not all of the Naiads who made their home in the waters of Tyrra linked themselves to the seas to maintain their immortality. Some chose to let it fade and taste of life the way mortals do. These are the Sirens. Like their mothers before them, the Sirens need the waters for survival, unlike the Naiads however, they are not confined to it, and they can leave the waters for short times, as long as they do not go too far away. Many of the traits of the Naiads are found in their children the Sirens. They both have natural charm magics and are resistant to sleep and charm. The Sirens also breed true always having daughters who are also Sirens. They too seduce sailors into fathering their children, but unlike the Naiads who often keep the sailors around or release them unharmed back to their world, the Sirens most often leave them to drown once they are pregnant.

### Goblins

Many noted scholars have remarked on the similarities between the goblins of Tyrra and the Dark Goblins of Faerie. The reason for these similarities is relatively easy to fathom. The two are basically of the same race, the only difference being their lack of innate magics. The Dark Goblins often switch mortal babies at birth and these warped children when discovered by the parents are often abandoned to the wilderness. Goblins often survive this abandonment since they can go for extended periods of time on little to no food and they mature to adulthood in a week. By one day they are similar to a human child of eight and know enough to stay away from predators including humans. These abandoned goblins tend to gather together and then they begin reproducing at a fantastic rate. If one male and one female goblin are loosed in an area they can have a tribe in a month. Similar to their Fae cousins, the goblins are not very smart and work better in numbers than they do individually. The loss of immortality also came with a loss of skill. Most mortal goblins cannot progress very far in their learning. Some are larger and slightly smarter holding more of their ancestry, these are called hobgoblins. The goblins of course know nothing of their origins and can never achieve the sort of power held by a Dark Goblin Lord. Goblins on Tyrra no longer seek to steal children, being more concerned with surviving. It is rare that goblins would resurrect as they are incapable of casting formal magics to create their own circles and are so disliked that few would resurrect them at their circles. Some evil beings have been known to offer resurrection to the goblins to aid the spread of misery.

### Minotaur

A long time ago on Faerie there was a land now lost called Magh Aei, which means plain of grazing. Here dwelt an intelligent race of bulls called the Tarb, which were among the races of Fae. These bulls lived and grazed and ignored the Fae around them other when they would line up to stampede through those Fae who would come in and try to take their lands. The Tarb lived in peaceful harmony until the day a gremlin crept into and whispered words of coercion in the ears of one of the Tarb leaders. "You and your followers are white in hue," he said, "this clearly marks you as superior to the plain Tarb whose common brown coloring makes them resemble nothing more than the dirt for you to tread upon." Night after night the Gremlin would whisper these words into the ears of the white Tarb until they came to believe them in their hearts and began to treat their brown brothers with derision and scorn. They began to feel that they should be the natural leaders of their people and started to seize power for themselves. This led to the great Tain, their word for war that roughly translates to cattle raid. The white and brown Tarb fought each other back and forth with the war culminating on Druim Tarb, the ridge of the bull. The brown Tarb were victorious, but their herd was cut seriously in number and could no longer defend their lands when the Unseelie came marching in. The Gremlins plan at last revealed, if the Unseelie could not defeat the Tarb they would divide them and let them defeat themselves. So, unable to fight, the Tarb fled from their beloved home of Magh Aei and traveled across Faerie until they found their way through a gate to Tyrra. Here they found open fields to graze in and a new home away from the Unseelie. They grew mortal on Tyrra as all Fae do in time, and changed, they began to walk erect on their hind legs which changed to become more muscular though they kept their hooves. Their forelegs became arms and here they developed hands as most mortal races have. They still maintained the bull's head and the bullheaded aspects of their personalities. The herd grew and prospered and divided into new herds. One of the first such herds called themselves the Tain, as a reminder of the war that cost them their home. Though they are pacifistic due to the trauma of the war, they will never again allow their home to be taken. This attitude goes through the more violent and militant herds as well.

### Unicorns

Unicorns are creatures native to the Wood on Faerie. Thought they are not a Fae by birth and thus are not affected by living on Tyrra. Though considered magical animals they far surpass the intelligence and magical nature of all other magical creatures from Tyrra. They are long lived but only measure their lives in hundreds of years. They are protectors of the forest and will attack anything defiling it. They are creatures of purity and innocence and because of this their horns are said to have the power to cure anything and make the darkest of hearts see love and light. The Lord of the Haunted Wood has corrupted some of the unicorns and bred them so they are naturally corrupt and opposite the unicorns. The black unicorns take to chaos as they are now born to it.

### Hounds of the Hunt

The Hounds of the Hunt were once normal dogs until they were brought to the Wood. While there they ate of only the food of Faerie and drank only of its waters. This changed them to have several Fae like traits such as resistance to sleep, charm, and fear effects. They also have the ability to cause others to be paralyzed with fear or fall into a deep slumber. These hounds are sent out in the Wood and on Tyrra in packs to hunt down those who defile the wood. They are led by the Masters of the Hunt who are captured evil mortals transformed by the Lady of the Forest to hunt their own, a punishment for their misgivings.

## Those Mortal Races Which Now Reside on Faerie

Just as there were Faerie races that crossed the Veil to Tyrra and now make their home here, so there are mortal races that crossed the Veil to Faerie and now reside there. Most of these races are warriors and live upon Hy Falga where they constantly do battle against each other testing themselves in contests of martial prowess and feats of strength. Though they are much fewer because of the long term effect on the mortal mind there are those who reside on Arcadia for the simple pleasure and love of the beauty of the realm as well. Like several other Tyrran races those who now reside on Faerie have learned the secrets of resisting and breaking charms. Living exposed to the Fae, nearly all of whom can charm with a glance was inspiration for this learning. These races have adapted to living within the magic of Faerie and have become immortal in the same fashion that the Fae are. This long life is actually confusing since mortals do not experience time on Faerie in a strict linear progression as they do on Tyrra, it is actually possible to meet members of these races after they have met you. The members of these races rarely leave Hy Falga other than on heroic quests which are part of their passages to manhood. Oftentimes groups of these races will stumble through a portal and find themselves once more back on Tyrra which causes all sorts of interesting situations. Especially considering the random nature of the portals which may place them anywhere or anywhere on Tyrra.

### The Fianna

The Fianna are a group of highland barbarians that crossed over into Faerie without even realizing it. They still do not know that they are not on Tyrra any longer. They are organized in tribes called battalions and governed in military lines. The Fianna are very superstitious, only trusting their own magics and fearing the strange warping of the lands around them. The one benefit the Fianna have is that not long after they came across the Veil, they saved a group of trader folke from a Dullahan. In gratitude seeing how they would need special help to survive on Faerie, the Trader Folke gave the wise man of each of the twenty five battalions of Fianna a magic sack. Each morning every member of each battalion can reach into the sack and will pull out an enchanted item. The item will last for the day and then disappear before the next dawn. With this gift each of the Fianna always has at least one item to aid them in their survival on a strange and inhospitable plane. The sack only works in the hands of the Fianna wise men and if taken will return to their hands by the next dawn. The Fianna hold these sacks as sacred relics and trust the powers of any item which comes from the bag.

### The Craobh Ruadh

The Craobh Ruadh are an order of knights who dwelt on Tyrra long ago. They were founded soon after one of the minor skirmishes between the Elementals on Tyrra that nearly became a new elemental war but fell short. After seeing the devastation caused by the forces of chaos they founded the Craobh Ruadh which means Red Branch. They are a strict knightly order with a code that makes the code of chivalry look like rules for a four year old. The entire order is made up of families for no member will dilute his purity by marrying outside the order. When they go to battle the warriors lead the way and the families serve as the support troops, healers, and supply captains. Many Generations ago the Craobh Ruadh were in pursuit of the army of great necromancer lords who called themselves the Togail or destroyers. In an attempt to escape the Togail entered a forest thought to be a domain of the Fae and both groups ended up in Faerie on Hy Falga. Here the two groups met in battle and the night after the first engagement a Badba came out to devour the dead. The Craobh Ruadh now knew why they had come to this strange land, it was to battle these evil creatures of death and chaos. The fact that the Badba were scavengers and not undead mattered little to them, they were so disgusted by what they saw they dedicated themselves to wipe the Badba out of existance. The Craobh Ruadh have for some reason seen less time pass than the other mortal races on Faerie and many of the first generation are still alive.

### The Togail

Togail means 'destroyers' and they are descended from the army of the necromancer lords who the Craobh Ruadh chased to Faerie ages ago. They still follow the teachings of the necromancers. Each member of the Togail no matter what their skills learn to cast necromantic magic to one degree or another. The Togail follow a King they simply call The Necromancer and he or she is the most powerful earth mage of their generation. None of the Togail ever became undead for something about their area of Faerie prevents Formal Magics from working. Any time they have tried, the Formal Magic backlashes and the caster is warped into a monstrosity loosing their head and becoming a Dullahan. The Togail are still at war with the Craobh Ruadh and wish to rule all of Hy Falga before attacking and seizing the mainland of Faerie.

## The Afflicted

Many of the afflicted spirits that haunt Tyrra and parts of Arcadia are now or once were creations of greater Fae Afflictions or even in some cases the curse of Kings. The word Banshee for example is a corruption of the name Bane Shide, meaning evil Faerie. Unlike some of the races such as Mystic Wood Elf or Cyclops which were also the result of a curse of Kings, these afflicted are dread spirits which do nothing but carry out the will of the one who afflicted them.

### Banshee

The Banshee were first formed long ago shortly after the first hostile encounter between the Fae and the mortals of Tyrra. One of the Fae Princes who was loosing a battle against a hosts of men sent a group of Firbolg and Redcaps to destroy the families of the mortals in the hopes that such a loss would shake the warriors confidence and allow him to easily defeat them. The women of their village saw the Redcaps coming and sent the children into hiding and stood up before the host of Fae in order to allow their children to get away. The children escaped but the women were all slaughtered. When the men found this out they did not lose heart as the Prince had hoped, the men went berserk and slaughtered the Fae host, capturing the Prince himself in a Cold Iron cage. The warriors brought him to the remains of their village and set him in front of the bodies of their wives. How can you do such evil said the leader of the men, how can you kill indiscriminately like this. The Prince looked at him and replied I do what I will, but I will return your wives unto all of you in repayment for my defeat. He turned and faced the bodies and said "May ye rise again to complete what was unfinished, may your rest be unsettled and thus may you bring others to your bed." and with that spirits began to rise out of the bodies of the wives and they moaned and screamed and brought all of their husbands to join them in death. Thus were the first Banshees created and though the affliction has weakened over time it still has some force behind it. Now when a woman afflicted by the Fae dies she will return as a Banshee. A Banshee can only be put to rest by removing the affliction left on their spirit before death. If a Banshee is struck down it will simply rise again the next night until put to its proper rest. When a Banshee appears all should beware for it is a dangerous creature, but they should also pay close attention to its words, deeds, and actions for in them is hidden what is required to remove the affliction. For a Banshee, though it can speak, cannot directly communicate to the living and is driven to kill all who it encounters, so it must lead others to put it to rest in subtle long term communications.

### Earthhaunts

Earthhaunts are the perfect example of a good affliction gone wrong. They were created by the affliction of the Lady of the Forest herself during the first encounters between her forces and those of the Lord of the Haunted Wood. When the Lady saw the devastation caused by the corruption of the Haunted Wood, and the draining of the life force by the chaos, she uttered her curse of Kings. The Lord of the Haunted Wood was young at this point and did not have the power to utter such an affliction so he could not stop her. "May the earth rise up against such horror, when drained let it fight for itself so it may renew." It was not long before she saw the error of her affliction. The result of the affliction was that in areas that had been severely drained by the corruption, a spirit would arise and seek to renew its land with life force. Of course the problem is that it could not make such life force, it had to take it from others who had it, namely the living. The rising of the Earthhaunts as they came to be known actually strengthened the power of the Lord of the Haunted Wood and accelerated his rise to power. When an area is drained Earthhaunts may still rise, their power directly related to the extent of the draining.

### Master of the Hunt

Perhaps to make up for the problems she caused by mistakenly creating the Earthhaunts, the Lady of the Forest uses her greater affliction to create Masters of the Hunt. These afflicted individuals are former hunters or miners or others who abused the land by overworking it or using it for sport and not survival. Some of these stumbled into the Wood to do their business and were caught by the guardians of the Wood and brought before the Lady of the Forest. Those she afflicts now run with the Hounds of the Hunt and stop those like themselves from doing harm to the delicate balance of nature. The Masters of the Hunt can afflict others as well, their affliction causes others to join the Hunt as long as the Master lives. If the Master dies it frees all those caught in the Hunt. If the Master lives and brings those he has afflicted back to the Wood with him, they will be judged and turned into Masters of the Hunt by the Lady of the Forest as well. Once one becomes a Master of the Hunt the only route to freedom is resurrection or for others to convince the Lady of the Forest to remove the affliction. Only time or the magic of the Lady can heal a Master of the Hunt.

### Corrupter

When the Lord of the Haunted Wood began to spread his corruption outward the spread was slow for many opposed him and he had to corrupt each new individual himself to bring them to his way of life.

However, when he saw the Masters of the Hunt as afflicted creations to aid the Lady of the Forest he thought to do the same. His creations were called Corrupters after what they did to all around them. The Corrupters made it unnecessary for the Lord to be there personally to corrupt each individual plant, animal, or sentient being. Though unable to corrupt everything, the Corrupters may spread the taint of the Haunted Wood to any who dwell within the woodlands of Faerie or Tyrra. Once corrupted few things can actually remove the taint, the power of the Lady being one of them. Like the Master of the Hunt, the Corrupter has an affliction as well. His is called the Plague and it sickens individuals rendering them under his enslavement. They are compelled to aid him in spreading his taint and like those taken by Masters of the Hunt, if they survive to be brought back to the Lord of the Haunted Wood they will be turned into more Corrupters. The

Corrupters only hope of freedom is for the affliction to be removed or resurrection. Like most other afflicted, only time will heal the Corrupters, though the Lord of the Haunted Wood can heal them with his necromancy as well.

### Fir Gruadh

The Fir Gruadh or Grey Man is an afflicted assassin. Few very powerful Fae Lords can utter an affliction of transformation to create a Fir Gruadh. They do so to take vengeance on one who has greatly wronged them. Often the recipient of the affliction will be someone close to the individual to be killed. This makes the death even more painful. A Grey Man will be unrelenting in its assault upon its target, the affliction makes them immune to any physical attacks by its target. Until it kills its target, it will arise again if killed. Once the target resurrects from their hand, the affliction is lifted and the Fir Gruadh is freed.

### Fir Darig

Fir Darig means man of luck and that is indeed what they are. No one is sure what sort of affliction is responsible for the existence of the Fir Darig, though they are definitely afflicted for removing a greater Fae affliction will return them to normal. Around a Fir Darig luck is warped and strange events happen such as furniture falling apart, the same person winning a game of chance repeatedly, a flipped coin always landing on edge, etc. etc. Again it is unsure what the purpose of the affliction upon them is, though it is thought to be of Unseelie origin, perhaps to spread the misery they enjoy giving to others. For some reason, a Fir Darig is also compelled to wear at least one article of clothing which is red.

Again no one knows why.

### Fir Caille

The Fir Caille is the man of wood. They are another afflicted being the result of the Lady of the Forest. In Faerie whenever you strike at a tree to cut it there is a blast of magical energy which is strong enough to kill most people. Due to a curse of Kings on the Wood itself, any who die there from cutting wood will rise again as a Fir Caille. They are compelled to wander the world killing those who cut live trees or damage them in any way. They are only semi intelligent and can't easily be reasoned with, but they can often be tricked. They are strong enough to rip out of any binding magic, incredibly resistant to weapons and somewhat resistant to imprisoning magic. However being made of wood, they are highly susceptible to flame.

## Fae Marks

Certain Fae can place a mark upon an individual. This mark can be placed as a punishment or a reward. The mark can be anywhere upon the body but must be put on with makeup each time the player comes into game. If the player is allergic to make up a compromise can be reached. Most Fae will place the mark where it will be seen, on the face, forehead, hands, or arms. Most marks will be a symbol but occasionally it will be a word. The mark follows the rules of the formal magic create mark/destroy mark as listed in the NERO International Formal Magic System. The only two exceptions to this is it will be identifiable as a mark comprised of both earth and celestial magic and the only way to remove a Fae mark is to have a Fae remove it.

## Fae Foods and Drinks

The consumption of Fae foods and drinks by non Fae cause any one of these effects. Food and drink detect as magical and can be identified but are not poisons for the purpose of the game skill resist poison. All effects are only cure able by a remove affliction unless stated otherwise in the effect. All effects are determined randomly with a 12 sided dice roll:

*Drinks*:

1. 24 hours of intoxication, cured by usual means. In-game skills are not affected.
2. One hour of incurable intoxication. In-game skills are not affected.

## Fae Constructs

Fae constructs are controllable moving constructs made entirely of the essence of Faerie that have some ability to affect the world around them. Due to the nature of magic that is used to create them they are not able to be created via the Formal Magics Create Golem. There are two types of Fae constructs: Faerie Fires, and Phantasmagorias. A Faerie Fire simply protects the creator, it has no ability to deal damage, but acts as an interposing moving object which is unaffected by all physical attacks. A dispel magic will however crumble a Faerie Fire construct. A Phantasmagoria is a construct that appears as any given race but not a specific individual. It has abilities dictated by its statistics in the monster manual and is crumbled by a dispel magic.

Any existing Fae Construct or Create Fae Golem Scroll must be marked LCO by the issuing chapter and expires on 1/1/2013. A 'Fae Duplicate' no longer exists.

## Fae Magic Items

Fae magics can have odd effects on the world of Tyrra. Quite often these magic items may have some sort of stigma attached to it much akin to the Formal Magic Flaw/Backlash effects (found in the NERO International Formal magic system) or a Fae Affliction. However, please note that these magic items must always conform to the NERO Formal Magic System and Treasure Distribution Policies.

Any existing Fae Magic Items that do not conform to the formal magic system must be marked LCO to the issuing chapter and expires on 1/1/2013.

## The Aisling

The Aisling is the Fae word for vision or dream. There are many things in Faerie which can rigger mortals to have an Aisling. Aislings are often prophetic in nature showing brief glimpses of the future. Other times Aislings give fairly detailed instructions on a quest or series of quests of importance to the dreamer.

## Wishes

A few of the Fae have the ability to grant wishes. Use of this ability and approval of any particular wish is always at the discretion of the local plot committee and/or the NERO International Office. Faeries must use the standard Formal Magic rules and treasure distribution in order to grant rewards to PCs. Any wishes or favors must be mundane items, formal effects, spirit effects, magical items, or formal magic scrolls and can in no way go against the current rules and errata as per NERO International. Any existing Fae wishes that do not conform to the formal magic rules must be marked LCO to the issuing chapter and expire on 1/1/2013.

## Fae Curses / Afflictions/ Abilities

Fae Curses are now called “afflictions” though they may often be referred to as a “curse” , and can be used by any form of magical creature, as determined by Plot. (Some examples of common creatures that can use afflictions are Elemental Icons, Animal Totem Spirits and High Mages.) Afflictions must follow the rules described below. An affliction has no duration and does not use up a formal magic slot on the victim’s spirit. Afflictions can usually be removed by a destroy magic formal spell of either school, but Plot may determine any criteria they wish for removal so long as it is documented ahead of time. Afflictions are applied by at least one full minute of concentration, during which the user must be touching the victim with a spell packet. If the user takes body damage or uses any other game skill, the count is interrupted and that use of his affliction ability is wasted. The user will typically roleplay channeling magical energy or casting a powerful spell during this count, but specific roleplay requirements may be determined by plot. The amount of time required is also up to plot’s discretion, but may not be shorter than one minute. An affliction may never be delivered by any form of weapon or packet attack except for the above described method of touch casting. However the victim may not refuse an affliction like they could a touch-cast battle spell. Also Plot or the NPC must provide the individual they are afflicting with a copy of the description to keep of the specific affliction being put upon them. All of these abilities must be listed and approved on the monsters card before going out and must follow the NERO International 9th Edition rules. For example, older abilities such as “Glamour” are no longer valid and may not be used.

### Afflictions

There are four types of affliction; lesser, greater, area, and master (or Kings curse). The ability lesser affliction includes remove lesser affliction and greater affliction includes remove greater affliction. Area affliction is considered a subset of greater affliction and can be removed by remove greater affliction or remove area affliction. A master affliction (or Kings curse) is not removable by normal means.

#### Lesser Afflictions

In essence, a lesser affliction is very similar to the gypsy curse and follows under the same rules, guidelines, and restrictions with the exception for the delivery method which is talked about previosuly. Players can make reasonable refusals until a compromise is made. For example, a brownie elder afflicts a player’s face to be blue. The player is allergic to make-up, so the affliction is changed that they must complement everyone they see at least once a day who wears blue garments. Any lesser affliction can be removed by any creature of the same type who has the lesser affliction ability, whether or not they gave the original affliction. Remove lesser affliction cannot be any other kind of affliction, wish or curse. A remove lesser affliction will only remove one specific lesser affliction, not all lesser afflictions upon the individual. All lesser affliction abilities are times per day only. A lesser affliction cannot affect the recipient's skills or combat ability in any way. There are some specific lesser afflictions listed below. These are given out specifically to plot-related Fae. Most lesser afflictions are related specific to certain types of Fae.

##### Litany Curse (Brownies)

This curse causes the player to say a specific phrase at designated periods until removed. The phrase can be up to thirty words of the NPC’s choice (NPC must write it down for the player to use as a cheat sheet). The phrase is keyed off to an event rather than a specific time. You can’t tell the player to say the phrase at 5:30 PM, but you can tell them to say the phrase the first time they see the Regent every day or when the main course of the feast is given to them. Players cannot whisper the phrase, they must say it so at least one person can hear it. The phrase is delivered immediately upon the event that cues the curse. The player only has to say the litany once per time it is triggered.

Incant: “By my wagging tongue, I curse you to say <phrase here and description when>“

##### Miser’s Curse (Leprechauns)

This curse causes the player to lose a set amount of money every game day to be handed over to logistics until it is removed. If the player turns in money to max out then first the amount of the curse must be removed and not count towards max out. If they hand in enough to cover the loss and the max out they can max out in full.

Incant: “By My Pot of Gold I curse you to lose <amount> a day”

##### Curse of Spoiling (Gremlins)

This curse spoils a particular food (anything except spices and bread) as they are eating it. It affects no game skills, but role-playing out the struggle to finish a spoiled meal is suggested.

Incant: “By Oberon’s tankard <full plate> may all the <put food type here> you drink <eat> be spoiled”

##### Curse of the Beholder (Fomoire)

This curse causes the player see at random intervals hallucinations of horrible, nameless monsters in the place of players. Hallucination monsters cannot be specific monsters from the monster database like Troll or Death Knight. They can be described in such a manner as to not confuse the player with other monster types: “Having a thousand tentacles and yellow bile coming out of every orifice,” “Thirty blood red eyes protruding from a tortoise shell and crab legs for feet,” “like an inside-out melon gliding on it’s own puss,” and so on. This effect can take place twice per game day and lasts for five minutes intervals.

Incant: “With the eyes of ancients, I curse you to see the world through a darkened veil.”

##### Curse of the Masque (Fomoire)

This curse places an non-removable “mask” over the cursed’s face. The mask rep must be supplied by the NPC and approved by the safety committee beforehand. The cursed must be able to eat, talk, hear, and breathe easily in the rep and if size is an issue, the player can opt to make a mask with the same features to fit their size. Alternatively this can change appearance in a manner similar to gypsy curse using prosthetic body parts or makeup.

Incant: “To improve upon what nature has made ugly, I curse a masque to hide your face.”

##### Curse of Inebriation (Clauricaune)

This curse inebriates the cursed for a given amount of time each game day. The time which it affects the recipient is stated in the curse. No game skills affected.

Incant: “Each day at <time or event> 'til <time or event>, I curse away all sobriety.”

##### Curse of Dreaming (Gan-ceann)

This curse causes the recipient to fall into a dream of little to no consequence. Most often this curse only lasts for one dream, but certain very strong Fae can cause the recipient of this curse to fall into dreams on repeated occasions.

Incant: "To wile away your hours, I curse you to dream while waking"

##### Curse of Greed (Dark Goblin Lords)

This curse causes the recipient to be overcome with greed. They will always claim any treasure for themselves and not be willing to share money or jewelry. They will become covetous of others valuables and may plot to steal them if they so choose.

Incant: "By the hoard of the miser, I curse you to desire all riches"

##### Curse of Disgust

This curse causes the recipient to become disgusted by a given object, person, or action. Each time the cursed individual sees the object of his disgust they must role-play intense disgust and physical discomfort over it.

Incant: "Since you offend me, I curse you to be offended by the sight of <item>"

##### Curse of the Black Thumb (Gnomes)

This curse causes the individual to be unable to grow plants of any kind. No matter how skillfully they grow them, no matter how much care they give them plants will sicken and die in their care. Flowers or cut plants will wilt and blacken in their hands. This curse has no effect on vegetable monsters but Dryads will be digested by any who bear this curse.

Incant: "May your toils of the earth be for naught, may your thumb blacken"

### Greater Afflictions

A greater affliction is not the same as gypsy curse. These are meant to be powerful detriments against a player who has offended a powerful being in some way. Greater afflictions can affect skill usage and combat ability as well as other physical traits of the recipient. These afflictions are pre-approved by a plot committee and staff before they go out. The beings who have the ability to give a greater affliction are rarely limited in what afflictions they may pronounce, but the specific afflictions that a creature is allowed to give for that encounter must be on their monster card and signed by an Owner, Head of Plot, a current Marshal or Staff member. Remove greater affliction can remove lesser afflictions and greater afflictions, but not gypsy curses, or master (Kings curse) affliction. Remove greater affliction will only remove a specific affliction, not all greater afflictions on the individual. All greater affliction abilities are times per day only. Unless noted, these effects cannot be removed by any means except by a remove greater affliction. All incantations must be clearly audible by the target. Below are a list of standard greater afflictions.

##### Curse of Devotion

When cursed, the player cannot inflict harm or allow harm inflicted upon any of the type of Fae who gave them this curse.

Incant: “Through the good graces of the Fae, I curse you to devote yourself to my kind.”

##### Curse of the Senses

This curse will cause sensory overload to the cursed at a random time no more than once per game day. When afflicted by the sensory overload, they will act as if paralyzed for five minutes with no cure. At which time, a plot person with a white headband will be recounting an experience through the five sense they are viewing an occurrence in the Faerie realm through the eyes, ears, etc. of a Fae. After the short descriptive table-top, the person “returns” to their own body and is no longer paralyzed. Incant: “Trading one eye for another, I curse you to experience our realm as we do.”

##### Curse of the Dance

This curse causes the recipient to dance for a given amount of time each day, it can happen at a certain time or a certain event can trigger it. The recipient must dance even if his life is in danger, the urge overwhelms his feet and he looses control, this will prevent them from running.

Incant: "Since you do not appreciate art each day when <time or event> you shall imitate art"

##### Curse of Bonding

This curse bonds the cursing Fae to the cursed. The only way to kill the Fae is to kill both the cursed and the Fae simultaneously to resurrection. The cursed however, gets the lower end of the deal. They can be killed without the Fae’s death alongside and resurrect as normal not like bottled, but the curse is removed upon their resurrection either way. Plot deaths do not count in removing this curse.

Incant: “By the handfasting of the three-who-are-one, I curse you to bond with me.”

##### Weakling’s Curse

This curse cuts players body points to two-thirds of player’s maximum and causes the individual to be under the effects of a weakness spell (as per page 82 of the NERO international rulebook) neither of these effects can be restored until the curse is removed. This curse is not cumulative.

Incant: “By the might of the elves, I curse you to be a weakling.”

##### Curse of Insanity

This curse causes the player to babble nonsensical words and phrases at random intervals for up to one minute at a time. All of the nonsensical words and phrases are delivered by staff members only. Incant: “By the tongue of the raving mad, I curse you to babble as if crazed.”

##### Curse of the Shared Voice

This curse causes the player’s voice box to be linked to the fey who cursed them. At random intervals, the plot committee will go up to the cursed player and tell them that they are compelled to say word for word in a clear voice something the cursing fey wishes them to say. These can be phrases specific to the circumstances the player is in as the Fae can see and hear what they’re doing. Often the recipient of this curse will not realize what they are saying as they are saying it and will have no memory of saying it afterward.

Incant: “With the mischief of the Dark Goblins, I curse you to speak my mind.”

##### Curse of the Eavesdropper

This curse causes the player to be linked to the cursing fey in such a way that at certain times the Fae can hear and see what the player hears and sees. The Fae who causes this is a plot controlled NPC, will always go to the player with a white headband on when they are listening and looking in. They must say to the player that they feel as if they’re being watched. Incant: “By the prying nature of the faeries, I curse you to be my eyes and ears.”

##### Curse of the Weak Stomached

This curse causes the player to be abhorrent to the gruesome tasks necessary in incapacitating and killing others. The player cannot killing blow, maim or break any bones of their opponents.

Incant: “To rid the world of brutality, I curse you to rend no unspeakable wounds.”

##### Curse of Elvin Cowardice

This curse on elven and mystic wood elven players causes them to be unable to use their racial ability “resist charm” or “charm break” on Fear based attacks.

Incant: “By the countenance of the Dullahan, I curse you to be afraid of those who instill fear.”

##### Curse of the Seer

Often times consider more of a gift this curse is extremely similar to the Curse of the Eavesdropper with the exception that follows. This curse bounds the player and a specific Fae so that while the recipient or Fae concentrates they can see through each others eyes. This curse is only a visual and not an audible based curse.

Incant: “By our close relationship may our eyes be as one in times of need, I curse you with my vision.”

##### Curse of Transformation

This curse will cause the recipient to transform into another form. The form is determined by the curse as is the time frame of transformation. Some transformations are for certain times and others remain until removed, the latter are extremely regulated and usually not used on PCs. An example of this curse is the Lady of the Forest's ability to turn those who desecrate the wood into Masters of the Hunt. However a periodic transformation would be similar to Lycanthropy but the PC would in general lose control of himself during the time of change. An example of this would be turning into a pig whenever they eat because they disturb a Fae Lord at his meal. This curse is very closely controlled by plot and may only be used with prier approval because it is considered a curse and not a Formal Magic Transformation, so the recipient may posses both this curse and a Transformation.

Incant: "Because of your actions to offend me, I curse you to become a <creature transformed to> for <duration or action which triggers>"

##### Curse of Deaths Embrace

This curse will cause a specific spell, as determined by plot, to act as a death spell upon the recipient (as per page 18 of the NERO International Formal Magic backlash table). This is a tightly controlled curse.

Incant: “To quicken your demise, may the spells you love so much send you to your death.”

##### Curse of the Aisling (Gan-ceann)

This curse is often considered more of a blessing. It is specific to the Gan-ceann and causes the recipient to have an Aisling or quest-dream. The recipient will be given a dream directly from plot which has direct bearing to IG situations.

Incant: "So your future will be known may the Aisling fall upon you"

##### Curse of Magic's Wrath (Sidhe)

This curse causes a particular class of spell to do double damage. These are broad categories such as Flame, Ice, Lightning, Necromancy, and Healing. It is only spells that cause double damage, carrier attacks do normal damage. The source of the spell does not matter, it could be cast from memory, scroll, innate, arcane, or in potion form.

Incant: "For the damage you have done to me, <Damage type> shall damage you twofold hence"

##### Curse of Still Magic (Firbolg)

This curse causes the recipient to be unable to cast a particular spell until a specific action (determined by the NPC or plot) is done. Any spell is possible as the target of this curse. This includes casting from scrolls or items, but not drinking potions. If the spell is reversible the recipient can cast the opposite spell without the designated action.

Incant: "If you would use <spell name> against me, then nevermore shall ye use it"

##### Area Affliction

An area affliction is a special form of greater affliction that instead of affecting an individual affects a structure or parcel of land. A good example of this is a Clauricaune's ability to afflict an area to sobriety. If he is offended a Clauricaune will afflict a tavern or bar to sobriety and any drinks served within will have no intoxicating effect and any intoxicated people who enter will be sober while within, the intoxication will return once they leave.

##### Master Affliction or Curse of the Kings

Once every year, certain powerful Fae have the capability to create an affliction so powerful, that it would affect an entire race of people or area of Tyrra. The casting of these afflictions are limited to Kings/Queens, Princes/Princesses and the First Knight of each. These afflictions are predetermined by plot and rules committee and have the possibility of going out once every year into game if deemed proper. Some have already been noted in vague passages of local and racial history. These afflictions cannot be removed by any known means though they can be mildly modified by another Master affliction (or Kings curse) as is talked about with the Firbolg . A Master affliction (or Kings curse) can be used as a devastating weapon, however it is limited in that one can be prevented if opposed by another who can utter a Master affliction (or Kings curse). This keeps such powers in check and used infrequently. This is also a very powerful and very rarely used curse for the facts that its duration last for ten years and once a Fae issues his or her Kings Curse that specific Fae may not again utter a Kings curse until such time as their curse is changed by another Kings Curse or the ten years from their last Curse has reached its end
