## The Vampire Clans

3 Clans of Vampire Nobilty rule Vindale Keep and the surrounding villages:

**House of Bloody Shadows** (Beautiful Powerful Shadow wielding warriors and dominant leaders, very persuasive, diplomatic, but terrifying in battle with weaponry)

**House of Sanguinus Nocturna** (Blood Sorcerers and Experimenters of Vampiric Alchemy and Flesh abominations)

**House of Feral Howls** (Traditional “Vampire” stereotypes of very animalistic claws and deformed visages, control over the creatures of the night and woods)

3 Clans of Vampire Commoners the serve the Noble Houses of Vindale

**Clan of Creeping Death** (Vampire assassins, capture and eliminate threats for the nobility for gold and favors, tend to be very sloppy eaters and leave victims to die)

**Clan of Deranged Nightmares** (Vampire saboteurs, will enter a village and ravage resources and drive the villagers made from fear before the nobility arrives, but they are highly unstable and tend be very violent when challenged)

 **Clan of Shattered Bone** (Vampire shock troops, absolute brutes and very hard to control, tend to lash out when you tell them what to do without a way to calm them down)

Vindale once lived in peace from Vampire threat many years ago but under a blood moon, 3 Siblings were taken from a noble family in exchange for a debt paid off. The 3 siblings were captured by a small band of Vampires, the 6 founders of the Houses and Clans of the future Court of Vindale.

### House of Bloody Shadows 

is led by Lord Alvaro Balduino de-los-Reyes (Lord Reyes informally, his full name on written documents and for deals being struck), a former warrior king of a lost noble family. A charm tyrant but can be reasoned with diplomatically. Loves to trade boons and favors in a court setting. Would prefer to make a deal and win the battle without stepping foot on the field, but if enraged Reyes will take up his sword and show zero mercy to his foes or those who have slighted him. If you do not agree with him or submit to his will he will Dominate you to bow or enslave you to do his work un-willingly. He is the current Prince of the Vindale Court

House of Sanguinus Nocturna is led by Lord Magnus Erebus, a powerful magic scholar who devoted his studies in life to advanced formal celestial magic, in death he has become more  favorited with Necromancy research and rituals to create new breeds of undead abomination, his prowess as a Celestial wizard has never been questioned as he will openly challenge people to magical duels if they question him.

### House of Feral Howls 

is led by one only known as “Ravenlord”, In life Samiel Walker was a humble farmer and hunter for his king with an affinity for wild animals. When he was embraced to the night, he was left for dead in the forest by his Sire. The only creatures to hear his cries for help were an Unkindness of Ravens in the Vindale woods. They came and drank of his blood and became empowered by the essence of Darkness itself. They carried him to safety where Sameul began his undeath as in a cavern. Over time he has mastered the power of the corrupted animals of Vindale’s wilderness. He is always companied by a swarm of humanoid Ravens while will viciously defend him and attack on his command. 

Clan of Creeping Death is led by Khaldun Amaranth, in life Khaldun was a murderer and rogue to a deadly band of assassins. His throat was slit upon his embrace so he does not speak normally, his only means of communication is telepathy. He is very cold and calculating. He does not make deals. He will complete the contract at all costs. He will kill anyone who gets between him and his prey. He normally walks alone at night but on missions he is accompanied by a group of elite 

Rogues who ensure no witnesses or survivors are left. Clan of Deranged Nightmares is led by Zelos Arentis, A man of sick and twisted faith in life. 

Deranged from a young age and spoke with spirits who were never there to others but him. He trains his clan to inflict pain and misery on those who defy the masters of Vindale. He carries the preserved dead rabbit he had as a childhood pet on him (a magic item) as a means to communicate with the spirits whom arent seen. He might seem almost normal for a moment with his humor but don’t turn his back or his sinister nature will just get your throat slit while he smiles. Zelos summons Nightmare elementals when he is attack or feels fear cause his repressed child mentality can only be comforted by the Nightmares of Vindale.

###  Clan of the Shattered Bone 

is led by Mortimer Cerdic, a violent and brutal barbarian who ravaged the countryside in life for fun. The Tribe of Shattered Bone was known for its brutality and not even leaving a building standing in its wake. They would burn the building with you barricaded inside and slaughter who ran out like a game. If you draw a sword in their presence they will begin to attack. Raising your voice at them will just draw their attention to you. 

Mortimier likes to collect the heads of his victims, specifically the leaders/nobility in places they have conquered. Accompanied by an entourage of bloodthirsty savages who only wants your blood and heart
