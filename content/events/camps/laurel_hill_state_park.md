**Heat**: NOPE

**Showers**: Skechy as hell

**Bathrooms**: Communal bathrooms. BEWARE THE SPIDER!

**Q: Are there any hotels nearby?**
A: There are several hotels located just beyond the Pennsylvania boarder in Weirton, WV, which is less than 20 minutes from the camp site. The hotels include Holiday Inn, Comfort Inn, and Fairfield Inn & Suites. 

**Q: Where can I get food or other supplies off-site?**
A: Also located in Weirton, WV are a variety of restaurants and stores, including McDonalds, Wendy's, Sheetz and Eat N' Park (local chain open 24/7). There is also a 24 hour Walmart for anyone needed last minute supplies.

**Q: Where is the closest hospital if there is an emergency?**
A: The Weirton Medical Center is located less than 20 minutes away. The award-winning University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC) is located about 1 hour from the camp site. 

**Q: What are the camp site facilities like?**
A. Cabins are assigned on a first come fist serve basis, except for buildings that are in a specific location In-Game. The cabins are two or four man cabins with beds that are wire springs or plywood boards with **no mattresses**, so please bring bedding. This is a summer camp site so there is no heat! There will only be one electrical outlet and light in each cabin. (Note: Heaters are **not** permitted.) It can get very cold at this site at night, especially during early spring or late fall events. We suggest bringing extra blankets, even if it looks like it will be warm enough. Also, the bathrooms and showers are in their own individual facilities. Please note that our camp site does not allow bird seed packets.
