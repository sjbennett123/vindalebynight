Good adventuring citizens of Elysia, you are cordially invited by your good King to a feast. 

January 14th 623  from the hours of 9:30am - 7pm

The new year festivities will ring in a new era and a new Duke! Location will be at the estates of Grand Vizier Thermo, just outside of Glavorn, the capital city of Elysia. You are hereby ordered to bring mirth and happiness to this feast. 

Please join us in games of marshal combat, battles of the mind, best dressed and best table decoration, among others. The ducal knights are being asked to hold some of these tournaments and we ask anyone that wants to stand up and host a game or tournament in the honor of the new Duke volunteer themselves here below. 

Games and tournaments will be held before feast food is served and coronation announcement will be revealed just prior to food service. Audience with the Duke will occur after dishes have cleared from the meal. 

Please arrive promptly in your finest celebration attire and prepare yourself to have a fresh start to a prosperous new year of rebirth and rebuilding!

Yours in Honor Sir Auric Farrier of the Kings Orchestra

Plates and utensils are disposable this event due to logistical reasons. If you want to bring your own cool plates and utensils and WASH THEM IN YOUR CABINS AFTER so the kitchen sink doesn't get inundated, please feel free to do so.

**Friday Night:**

 **Saturday Breakfast**- 11ish

*Breakfast will not be until after 10am. Due to childcare plans, I'm driving in from an hour away in the morning. I plan to be on site by 10 at the latest. If you're an early riser and need anything, there will be fruit to get you going.*

My most crucial clean up volunteers will be at the conclusion of dinner time, so that I can get everything loaded in my car and head back to pick up my son. I think based on space, I'll need 2/3 people that know how to properly clean and dry. I know it becomes a popular cleanup request and I will be taking volunteers on a first come basis, based on who is standing in front of me when I need the help. I can't go searching for anyone on a sign up sheet.
