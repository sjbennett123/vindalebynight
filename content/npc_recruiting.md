**You cannot convert these people to PC’ing. They are a lost cause they will NEVER give you money.**

Larping is a social engagement. Often telling people who you have will encourage more people to come.

- Do a check-in mid event. See how people are feeling. 
- A goodie bag with stuff that people would actually want. RPG books for example. 

## After the Event

- Invite to postmortem meeting
- Go out to breakfast with the crew. 

## Ask for advice 

### Recruiting 

I'm working on doing  NPC recruiting for a NERO event that I get to run in a few months. Could I pick your brain sometime and get your tips for how to get more NPC's?
