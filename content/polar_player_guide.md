**POLAR Player’s Guide**

 

Hello and Welcome to POLAR. POLAR is a chapter of Nero International™ and if this is your first NERO event then welcome, if it is not please read through this short guide. It more than likely contains information that you are already familiar with and guidelines you already play by, but there may be new information concerning POLAR specifically. So read on and remember we’re all here to have fun.

**What You Can Expect From Us**

​      What can you as a player expect from the staff at POLAR? Well, let’s first start with the game, Plot WILL challenge you not only physically, but also mentally. They will also present your character with fair opportunities to be successful, what you do with those opportunities is your business. And while we are trying to run a heroic game we do understand and allow for the PC Villain. In addition the Hero and the Villain, we also notice that some players simply want to Role-Play, again we will allow for that character. The staff will also be on hand to listen to you so we can create the best game for all players. We realize that each person is unique and does not fit into the three narrow categories above, but if you are not having fun we need to know. Remember, we have a council that meets with the owner, a representative from plot, a representative from the marshals, a representative from the board, and a representative elected by the players. In other words, when in doubt talk to your player rep.

**What We Expect From You**

​      A rather ominous title for this section, wouldn’t you say? Well POLAR is a club and we ask our players to put a little more effort into the game. We expect you to speak to the player rep when you or your group is not having fun. If we don’t know it’s broke we can’t fix it. We expect you to play fair and not to cheat. Sometimes you get the bear, sometimes the bear gets you. We would also ask that you respect ALL players, both PCs and NPCs, out of game. Remember NPCs are only following orders from Plot, if you have a problem don’t blame them. Talk to a marshal and then your player rep. Finally, we would ask one last thing. Please, try to add to someone’s fun at every event. If you are part of a group then look outside the group for someone to interact with. This helps everyone in the POLAR club.

**General Announcements:**

​      We hold opening ceremonies at every event. Please attend, you will be held responsible for knowing any new information delivered at this meeting. Only specific people will be excused from this meeting. Example: NPCs setting up mod sites, which have already been briefed on the last minute information.

​      We do have an OOG absent player policy. Any player who misses four consecutive events without notifying staff will have been assumed to be missing in game. This will be handled in game is such manners as stripping of title, charges of desertion of post, etc. If it is a staff position you will lose your position. If you notify POLAR we will do everything reasonable to accommodate you.

​      Anonymous postings in POLAR newsletters, web sites, or in any other public property will not be tolerated. These posts will be deleted as soon at our earliest convenience.

​      You must wear a white headband if you are out of game. If you do not have a white headband on, you will be considered In-Game and must deal with all situations as they present themselves.

​      We do not follow the belief of auto-maxing for PCing an event. Instead we reserve that privilege for out NPCs. We feel we can present enough “good game” to satisfy all your LARPing needs.

​      We want to leave every site we use in better condition than we find it. Therefore everyone will be held responsible for the condition of their cabin and its surrounding area. In addition all players will be asked to clean a certain area designated by the Site Marshal. You must have the site marshal’s initials on your character sheet to receive credit for the event. 

​      Smoking will only be tolerated in designated areas.

​      If you wish to flee the In Game area you must follow this procedure. You must stay in an In–Game area for Sixty minutes without being detected. Detection is defined as any person who means to capture, harm, or in any way influence you in a negative way; makes it known to you, that they have seen or heard you.

​      The following rules for searching a character are currently in effect. Any person being searched has two options, when another player searches them. They may accept a simple three count and hand over all in-game items. Example: “I search you one, I search you two, I search you three”. Or, they ask the searcher to describe their search. The searcher must then use a three count on each location. Example: “I search your pouch one, I search your pouch two, etc” The method is determined by the person being searched.

**Spells and Magic Items**

​      When casting a spell, the damage or healing must be called after the incantation is finished. Example: “I call forth a Dragon’s Breath 40”.

​      If someone casts a life spell on you, you are responsible for knowing who that person is. We will actively seek proof of the origin of the life spell.

​      We feel the need for spell tags is unnecessary, however, to avoid confusion we will use the following system.

1. All memorized spells must be marked on a spell sheet.
2. As spells are cast, they are crossed off the spell sheet.
3. At any time plot or a marshal may ask to see your spell sheet. If you do not have a spell sheet or if is not correct, disciplinary action may be taken.

​      The use of magic items will follow national standards. You must have at least one hand free, you cannot be silenced to activate an item with a command word, and you must use the entire incant. Example: “Activate I call forth a Dragon’s Breath 40”.

**Plot, Marshals, and Tags**

Plot and Marshals rulings during normal game play are absolute. Harassment of marshals or staff regarding a ruling may be considered cause for disciplinary action. In general, going to a different marshal to get a favorable ruling will not be tolerated. This is considered cheating. If you do not agree with a ruling, quietly and politely request an adjudication form after normal game play hours.

​      Plot or Marshals may ask to see any tags at any time. If items do not coincide with effects, the owner must satisfactorily explain why, or receive some form of disciplinary action. Tags should be attached to their phys-rep. If not attached, a thief may steal either the rep or the tag.

​      The following meta-gaming policy will be in effect as of day one at POLAR: If you as a player hear about an in game occurrence from another player then your character also hears of the occurrence. We feel through these extreme measures, the problem of meta-gaming will show up less frequently. The best way to stop this problem is for all players to keep their actions a secret unless you wish everyone to know.

​      The following are the only exceptions to this rule:

1. Staff can tell a player something and inform them that their character    would not know the information.
2. In-Game amnesia effects (Death, Waylay, etc.)
3. Things you learn as a staff member (NPC, Marshal, Plot, etc.)

 

**In-Game Information for POLAR**

​      Some General In-Game information for all players. It bears repeating, an armed society is a polite society. Town is typically a safe haven; monsters are kept at bay by the local militias. It is a rare occasion for monsters to be in town. Also Nobles at POLAR typically have white or yellow (Silver, or Gold), as a dominant or secondary color on their tabards. If you see a white sash, the person wearing it is a Squire, and should be given the proper deference. The Guilds at POLAR are a very powerful force, and joining a guild does have its advantages. Joining a guild often gets you access either to a workshop or a circle. You must join in game, and usually pay a nominal monthly fee. Guild members are denoted by a felt circle with their guild symbol pinned to their costume. If you see a felt diamond you are dealing with a guardsman or sheriff, be polite. If the Circle of Felt is gold, be very Polite, this is a guild master, they play checkers with the local noble every Tuesday. When you join a guild they will give you the appropriate felt pin. While you do not have to wear it, it is believed you gain a certain protection from a guild that only works at night, if you wear it prominently. Now the guilds of course maintain they would never pay protection money to such a guild.

**A Final Word**

​       It seems that we have gone over a ton of information in a short period of time. Some final thoughts, remember your rulebook. The Hold rule, please, for everyone’s safety, follow it. Respect the other players, and understand it is not personal, at least Out of Game. Play fair and expect to be challenged fairly. If you are not having fun, approach you player rep and explain your problem calmly and rationally. Stay in character, and Role-Play. Above all have fun, and COME GET SOME!
