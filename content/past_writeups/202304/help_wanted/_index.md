description: Granny Whuthona Silverlode's family recipe book has gone missing! Also, she hasn't seen her grandson Huldrek in several days. In desperation, she has put two ads in the tavern asking for help in finding them both. She has offered a reward for the return of each. 

synopsis: > 
  A sweet old lady dwarf has put up a help wanted ad to enlist help returning her recipe book and her grandson for a reward. She doesn't know where her grandson would be, and needs help finding him. Her recipe book also went missing around the same time, and she can't find it anywhere. The book is full of old family recipes and is valuable. She insists it was stolen, and wants it back. She describes it in full detail to whoever is listening, and is quite proud of it. 
  Once everyone has talked and all information is relayed by Granny, she will see everyone to the door and wish them luck in finding her book! And her grandson, too.

outcomes: The PCs talk to Granny Whuthona Silverlode and are told information about her, her grandson, her recipe book, the occupation, or anything else people want to talk about. They are given a crudely drawn map found with Huldrek's things that will lead them to the Tarrasch Treasure.Once the PCs leave the house, the PCs have until Noon Saturday to find Huldrek at the cache [OPERATION FIND HULDREK].

running_notes: >
  Granny is an incredibly sweet dwarf, saying "dearie” this, and “sweetie” that. She explains that Huldrek has always had his troubles, but he is a good boy! He is so busy, he hasn't come home in days and she is worried for him.
  But worry for her grandson is eclipsed by her worry for her book! Someone must have broken in and taken it! It's been missing for the same amount of time as Huldrek. But that's just a coincidence!
  Granny is insistent that her grandson has nothing to do with her books disappearance, and shut down any talk otherwise,
  Granny will recommend that the PCs use Craftsman: Other-Tracking to track Huldrek.
  If Huldrek Silverlode is tracked using Craftsman: Other-Tracking [Level 1 or above] before Noon, he is tracked back to the Tarrasch cache, where he is guarding the Chest of the Tarrasch [YOU FOUND HULDREK]
