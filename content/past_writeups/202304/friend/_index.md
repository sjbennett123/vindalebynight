description: A Follower of the Lord of the Woods has emerged from his normal hunting patterns and made his way towards town. Unsure of his intentions he stalks from cabin to cabin seeking something about dreams. This is a  random encounter that will turn into a large module later in the evening
Synopsis: > 
  A “corrupted” Earth Knight wanders the edge of Stonewood seeking “dreams” to feed his hunger or the hunger his Lord seeks. The creature will stalk from cabin to cabin, building to building, lurking in the shadows for a victim to capture and carry off for his “feeding” and offering to the Lord of the Woods. The Corrupted Earth Knight stalks the Cabins area of campsite to catch players in a vulnerable spot, capturing is prioritized above killing,  The Earth Knight isn’t here to kill but rather to  feed on the dreams of the adventurers because they are ripe for the reaping. 


  If a PC is captured, they will be taken to the Dream-like realm of the Lord of the Woods and Rifted out on a normal 3 count to a secondary location where they will enter a roleplay encounter in a “Nightmare” induced state where the Lord of the Woods  “harvest” dream energy from them and replace their dreams with “Nightmares” effectively giving them a “paranoia” effect till sunrise to grow his power and return their asleep body to a random spot on the campsite to wake up and rejoin the game. 


outcomes: 
  - The Corrupted Earth Knight stalks the town and captures a victim to feed on, if the Earth Knight captures 3 people and successfully feeds, he will flee for 1 hr and then return with Cultists.
  - The PCs defeat the Corrupted Earth Knight and his resets, later in the night there is a follow up module where they are taken to a Grove where they are attempting to harvest Dream energy from Stonewood Citizens

  A Message Posted on the Black Anvil Mercenary Scouting Watch Boards

  Recent reports have described something of an Earthen Disturbance of sorts stomping through our woods. Some large humanoid covered in Vines has been stalking the woods near Stonewood. It seems like an Earth Elemental for all intents and purposes but he doesn’t respond or say anything other than muttering “Feed my Dreams…..” A few scouts have tried to engage him and it went less than ideal so be careful of this creature till we know more. He doesn’t seem overly hostile but he seems set on one purpose very intently

hook: None, This is a Roaming Encounter
running_notes: he card has 8 Physical Webs on it for a reason so use them. The Earth Knight will reset 5 times to try and capture 3 people or be defeated.
