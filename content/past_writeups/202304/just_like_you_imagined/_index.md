title: Just Like You Imagined
author: Chris Colland
reviewer: Scott Bennett
layout: module
description: Balor investigated a bloody fist Urukhai and discovered that some formal magic caused the black shadow to show up and kill everyone in the circle. Turns out some people need to learn that lesson themselves. 
schedule: reaction
requirements: 
  - Casting formal magic on the spirit of an Urakhai warror.
synopsis: If they cast any Formal ritual on a Bloody Fist Urk-Hai, it will be backlashed after 3 minutes of casting. Give them false hope and then BAM Roll on the chart. 
rumors: |
   The process that changes the orcs into the Uruk-Hai also taints their spirit. This magical effect identifies as Celestial, Earth, and Arcane (Dragon Magic). The Black Anvil Company enlisted an Earth Guild to Destroy Formal Magic, the spirit of a Orc and it horridly backfired. Though initially believed to be a a fluke further attempts also were met with dismal results.
