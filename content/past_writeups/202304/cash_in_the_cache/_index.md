description: Having met no resistance at the cache of the Tarrasch, the PCs return to Granny Silverlode to return her book and/or take word of her grandson to her.

synopsis: > 
  Once at Granny's house, she will offer the group cookies and thank them profusely. Granny pays the 20 Silver reward immediately. She wants to hear all about their adventure and how they found her book. She will vehemently deny that her grandson had anything to do with her book's disappearance and will change the subject if it is brought up. She also will not hear anything about where her grandson was found and with what. Effectively she stonewalls anyone who suggests her grandson isn't upstanding or hints at what he as been doing. She will also deny his drinking and gambling problems. Granny will get annoyed if anyone insists her grandson stole her book and kick out the PCs 

  
   - If Huldrek makes it back to his Granny's separate from the PCs, he is absent from the room. Granny claims he is in his bedroom resting. 
   - If the PCs bring back both the book and Huldrek, Huldrek will immediately try to leave to go to “his room”, and leaves after Granny searches him for coin. Huldrek refuses to talk or talk minimally if he is with Granny. Granny talks over Huldrek whenever he speaks.
