weight: 3
schedule: saturday early evening
layout: module
author: Chris Colland
reviewer: Scott Bennett
description: "The Bloody Fist are becoming very desperate to burn this town ashes! If nothing works this time then they will invoke the Ritual of Fire, preparations have already begun but this is a chaotic ditch effort. Unlike last time, they already came into town with prisoners they intend to execute."
Requirements: 
  - Fears by Torchlight has been already run
Synopsis: The Bloody Fist have taken the Town Librarian Ari-elle and the Mayors best friend also town drunk Thorum captive. They intend to execute them publicly if the PCs don’t surrender immediately. But this is also a distraction for another attempt to burn the town again. So the players are faced with a hard choice let the town burn or try to save 2 of the townsfolk from permanent death.
Running_Notes: This module is a chaotic no-win scenario for the characters. They must make a choice between the lives of 2 of the NPC townsfolk or stopping the Bloody Fist Scouts from burning down the town. This is like the earlier module “Fears by Torchlight”, but a different tactic is used. A distraction at the tavern gives the 2 scouts more chances to burn 6 new buildings and break the townsfolks spirits. If the buildings are burnt the townsfolk’s morale will be completely broken. If the town is saved, they will be much happier with only 2 people dying as a result, then losing their homes, a selfish choice but it is thematic for Dwarves to be greedy and selfish for their own gain. Also, one is just a drunk, who cares about him
Hook: 3 Bloody Fist Grunts march the 2 prisoners into view of the tavern, force them to their knees and call the PCs out.
