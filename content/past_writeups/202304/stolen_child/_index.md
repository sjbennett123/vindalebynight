schedule: saturday early afternoon

description: A child is taken from in front of his parents. The father chases the group to a cave out of town. He has returned to try to find help in retrieving his child.
synopsis: > 
  A distraught father, Varyn Gilchek comes running into town. He can be heard calling for help from a far distance [ex. "Please! You have to help me! Someone! They took him!" After he recovers from his run, he tells whoever will listen that, “Some people. They just snatched little Charlie right out from in front of our home!” He produces a smudged paper with a shepherd's crook [Tarrasch] symbol that was left in the wake of the kidnapping. If questioned thoroughly, and if pressed for a reason, the father will admit that he couldn't pay his tithe to the Bloody Fist, due to poverty, and assumes his son was taken in payment.


  He followed the kidnappers into the wilderness surrounding Stonewood and to a cave with a small entrance. After pausing for breath, he realized that he ran into a fight with no weapons and no backup. Reluctantly, he doubled back to town with the hope of gathering a party to help rescue his son. While the father sought help, the child was killed.  When the PCs enter the cave, they are set upon by the Tarrasch Pawns, then the Bishop. The Bishop will flee when there is a chance of being defeated. Each Black Pawn will give a silver, each White Pawn a gold, the bishop multiple gold. If the Tarrasch win the fight, someone is marked by the Tarrasch in blood and the rest are left for dead/ or are stabilized/robbed/etc. The Bishop will rob the PCs of their magic items and keep them on his person.
