requirements: Stonewood City Pest and Sanitation complete

description: The city's food stores are overran by giant field rats. TThe city is offering a 30 silver reward to the local adventurers to help clear the rats from the main grain store. 

synopsis: >  
  A group of adventurers enter the grain stores of the city to clear out the Giant Field Rat infestation. The grain stores are dangerous, and sink holes are easy to step into. Strewn around the room are yellow plastic table cloths, which represent grain sink holes. If a PC steps or falls into a grain sink hole, they can not move the part in contact with the sinkhole until they are rescued on a three count of "I pull you free". They can pull out a stuck player on a three count, as long as they don't touch the grain. A player cannot free themselves from the grain. The Rats are immune to the sink holes and may walk freely.
  There are three areas to clear, each one with less and less room to safely walk, and more rats as the walking space lessens. The first is a small silo, partially filled with grain, and has a small infestation. The second is a medium silo, half filled with grain and a heavier infestation. The last is the main grain store that is almost full and contains a very heavy infestation. All three levels must be cleared to receive pay.

  - The PCs clear out the rats and collect the bounty
  - The PCs do not clear out the rats, and they don't get a bounty
