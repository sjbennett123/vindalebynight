 The players are to be free to decide how they convince a Bloody Fist scout to converse with them. The way they do it will determine the outcomes and whether or not they learn useful information. Remember, Burdoc is pre-disposed to go with them to gather information also, so the players will always be successful in getting him to go with them to the tavern unless they just attack him outright. The mod will end when the NPC has given out the long term plot information and any tactical information the players have convinced Burdoc to provide. This will signal the start of the "Welcome to Orc Town" mod. When the approaching Orcs are noticed, Burdoc will stand up and say it is time to leave depart to report his findings back to the horde.


  *Examples of "Successful" Tactics by the players:* For Burdoc to become suitably loose-lipped and provide "tactical" intel,

   - plying Burdoc with food and drink will be helpful. 
   - show their subjugation and loyalty by defending Burdoc in some manner
   - Use a charm spell followed by friendliness, and a trip to the tavern for food and many drinks.
   - Use of an enslavement elixir (not likely they have one) but, if so, no other enticements are needed.
   - Waylay Burdoc. New rules mean he will know who did this, so that player has to disappear and the other players show up and "rescue" Burdoc, act friendly, and go to the tavern for food and drinks.
   - If Burdoc is attacked in any other way during the module and the players prove their "loyalty and subjugation" by defending him, and provide him food and drink.

  *Information for Burdoc to give out*

   - All of the contents of the contents of the zine. Knowledge to be fearful of the Bloody Fist.   
   - The Orcs have heard of Morumbrians and consider them enemies (Ritual of Fire). Veterans of the Morumbrian War in early 600 talk about heroes with Stonewood swords
