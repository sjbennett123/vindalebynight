description: A Bloody Fist Scout (Burdoc) and players attempt to outfox one another and gather intelligence about the coming confrontations.

synopsis: > 

  Blindor Silverlode, Venerable (retired) Guild Master of the Stonewood Woodcutters Guild and younger sister of "Granny" (Family Recipes Plotline), has just returned from Rockshire, and is deeply concerned. While there, evidence of possible damage coming to the Stonewood forest was recovered from a temporal anomaly, and she believes the Orc aggression may be a sign that the Morumbrians, an ancient enemy, was not fully defeated. She is also terribly worried that the town and adventurers are not prepared for what the Orcs have planned for them.
  
  
  Blindor knows that the lowest members of the Bloody Fist military structure, the Scouts, are regularly sent out to gather intelligence and are likely to be skulking around the town. She will go to the tavern and encourage a few stealthy adventurers to locate one of these Orcs and "convince" them to come back to the tavern for a drink with the "subjugated" townsfolk. Burdoc will be skulking about outside, for the players to find. The details of the informaiton gathering are collected in the section "Cat and Mouse"
  
outcomes: 
   - Players get whatever information their tactics earned for them and let Burdoc leave to join with the approaching Orcs. If they do this they may be able to make use of their connection to Burdoc again someday
   - Players get whatever information their tactics earned for them but attack Burdoc who will either escape to join the approaching Orcs or be taken down and killed. In this case, they will never see Burdoc again.
   - Players in the tavern attack the Orc while people are trying to get information and the players let them do so. Burdoc escapes or is dead and goes to resurrect. No information obtained or only what was obtained before the attack. Players will never see Burdoc again.

number_of_cast_members: 2

Hook: Burdoc, a Bloody Fist Scout, arrives in town and split up to spy and learn. Blindor Silverlode enlists aid of players to lure a him into the tavern and get them into a state where they might divulge useful information.

running_notes: There is no need for the scouts to fight the people of Elysia. They must rather discover a picture of the people that they hope to subjugate.
