title: Orc Intel
---
The Bloody Fist Scouts are always looking for more information on the people that the horde is working against. If you gain any information leave immediatly and report back to the horde. 

We are representing this by having a board with the inteligence gathered by the Bloody Fist Scouts in the NPC Shack with the results of their findings. Each unkilled Bloody Fist Scout will add to this board and build a picture of the town of Stonewood for the Bloody Fist Horde.

- identify possible targets for rituals the Orcs have planned. 
- Identify targets to take as hostages. If a hostage is taken run "Bonesaw's Black Site"
- Identify who is in charge and giving orders? 
- Identify people who can be bought or blackmailed.  If someone agrees to sell information in exchange for a bribe run "So you want to make a deal" 
- Where are magic items, relics, or rumors of lost magic?
- Are there surrounding defenses? 
- Identify where the money is kept.
