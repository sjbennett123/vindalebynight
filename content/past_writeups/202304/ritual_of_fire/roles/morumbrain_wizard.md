**Capture the Chosen One**: Your mission is simple, capture the Chosen One for The Dark Ones so he may be offered the Blessing of Murumbria. If someone steps between you and your goal, you will strike them down with your terrifying power over Darkness. f you capture the chosen one, you must carry him to the Gate to leave, you cannot rift with anyone else but yourself in this time. If the PCs step aside and don’t impede your hunt for the Chosen One, let them by and say something snarky to thank them for their “obedience” or remind them that they are “wise for respecting such power”

**IF THE CHOSEN ONE IS VISIBLE OR UNDEFENDED, DOWN HIM AND STABILIZE HIM, CARRY HIM TO THE GATE!!! HE IS ABOVE ALL THE PRIORITY!!!**
