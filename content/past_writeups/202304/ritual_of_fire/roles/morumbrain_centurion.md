  You are the elite of Murumbria! Your blades of shadow have torn through many Hoyleans in your time. The fears you have accomplished to reach the rank of Centurion are brutal and worthy of song.

**Capture the Chosen One**: Your mission is simple, capture the Chosen One for The Dark Ones so they may be offered the Blessing of Murumbria. If someone steps between you and your goal, you will strike them down with your terrifying power over Darkness. f you capture the chosen one, you must carry them to the Gate to leave, you cannot rift with anyone else but yourself in this time. If the PCs step aside and don’t impede your hunt for the Chosen One, let them by and say something snarky to thank them for their “obedience” or remind them that they are “wise for respecting such power”
