synopsis: The Ritual of Fire is a Bloody Fist ritual to rip open the Fire plane. They have used this in the past to great effect. The Flame Drake elementals are very destructive and serve the purpose of the Bloody Fist. But during the ritual, the forces of Darkness has corrupted the ritual and used it as a gateway to attack!

Outcomes:

Running_Notes: > 
  The Ritual of Fire being corrupted was NOT something the Bloody Fist expected. The Bloody Fist intended to run when the Flame Drake Elementals were summoned but the nature of the Murumbrians tainted the ritual. This forced obedience upon the Bloody Fist. 

  When the Murumbrians enter the field, the “Chosen One” will already have their Glowing Morumbrain Eyes active so the Murumbrians know who they are; and will hunt them for 1 hour. The entire site is active for play during this module. It is completely valid to hide and not fight them, but like a horror movie they will keep coming regardless.

  The Ley Lines of Stonewood have shifted dramatically as of recent. This, in my experience is the sign before a great ritual. To say what is to come is unknown. But the feeling on the wind is nothing but Sulfur and Pain. Stay Vigilant guard your components well.
