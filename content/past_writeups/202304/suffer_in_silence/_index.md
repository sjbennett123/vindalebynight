reviewer: Scott Bennett

schedule: saturday night
weight: 1
plotline: Lord of the Woods
requirements: Saturday Evening at Sundown, Friend? Has been ran
tagline: Underneath the darkened skies, through sleepless eyes, it leaves me wanting! 
description: The Lord of the Woods Cultists and the creature from the module "Friend?" have captured a few Stonewood Townsfolk and plan to make a Blood Sacrifice to the Lord of the Woods in a Grove. 
Synopsis: The Corrupted Earth Knight from the module "Friend?" and the Lord of the Woods Cultists are attempting to preform a Dream Harvesting and Blood Sacrifice to the Lord of the Woods. The Dream Harvestings give the Lord of the Woods more power and the Blood Sacrifices give the Lord of the Woods a strong corporeal shell on this physical plane of existence. They have captured 3 Stonewood Citizens that will be harvested and then sacrificed if they are not saved in time. Upon receiving the message at the tavern, the PCs have 30 minutes to reach and rescue the Stonewood Citizens or find their bodies drained of essence and life. Even if the citizens are saved they CANNOT be awakened from their Dream Coma, they are stuck in a state between life and dream almost death-like. If they are awakened with an Awaken spell or Elixir they will suffer a “seizure” and require a life spell. Only a Dream Elemental or the Lord of the Woods can bring them out of this state if the Ritual is interrupted like it was, this is the “backlash” that the sacrifies suffer from the ritual being interrupted.


Outcomes:
  - The PCs reach the Grove and defeat the Earth Knight and 7 Cultists within 30 minutes and recuse the Stonewood Citizens, but find they are locked in a “Dream Coma”
  - The PCs don’t reach the Stonewood Citizens and find their corpses drained of blood and essence OR they fail to defeat the Earth Knight and Cultist in the time and the Lord of the Woods reaps them from an Ethereal state of their dream energy leaving them drained of all but life essentially like a zombie

  A Message Posted on the Black Anvil Mercenary Scouting Watch Boards

  Recent reports have described something of an Earthen Disturbance of sorts stomping through our woods. Some large humanoid covered in Vines has been stalking the woods near Stonewood. It seems like an Earth Elemental for all intents and purposes but he doesn’t respond or say anything other than muttering “Feed my Dreams…..” A few scouts have tried to engage him and it went less than ideal so be careful of this creature till we know more. He doesn’t seem overly hostile but he seems set on one purpose very intently
hook: Black Anvil Scout brings word they have come across a Grove they saw the Lord of the Woods Cultist about to preform some kind of sacrifice in
scenes: 
  - 
    oog: Mod Shack(Outside Location if Weather permits) The scene is set with the 3 “sacrifices” laying in a Triangle in the middle of the Cultists who are standing around them with their heads down humming to themselves and playing drums. The Earth Knight appears to be the leader of this ritual and is groaning some form of chant.
