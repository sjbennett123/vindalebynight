description: A hunter collecting the rat tail bounty is seeking help in clearing out a large rats nest he found in a cave.

synopsis:  Cornelius Grayson, a hunter collecting the rat tail bounty, comes into town looking for a group to help clear out a nest he found. There are more rats than he can handle, and is willing to share the bounty. When the PCs get to the cave, there is a large colony of rats feeding off of dozens of people that have been thrown in the cave. Painted around the cave at about head height are several bloody fists painted in rust-red blood. The bodies are in varying states of decay, some fresh and some very old, mostly adults, but some small skeletons can be seen beneath larger ones. The rats are feeding on the flesh and are bloodstained. Fights occasionally break out among the colony as the eat. These rats are larger than their grain-fed cousins. As the PCs approach, the rats abandon their food and attack. Unlike the other rats, these attack without being provoked. These rats are super aggressive.
