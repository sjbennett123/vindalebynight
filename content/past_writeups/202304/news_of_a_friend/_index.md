synopsis: >
  Rose Norwish, wife to Luca Norwish, hasn't seen her husband since the night before. Luca came into Stonewood to find help in clearing some rats on a farmer's property in the module "Of Rats and Thieves" and didn't return. Luca didn't return because the Tarrasch killed him and chopped him up. That that Luca did not return is unexpected because he and his wife were very much in love before he was chopped into tiny bits. The body of Luca was delivered to the town that morning by the Tarrasch in the module "Breakfast in Pieces". 

  Rose is hoping that Luca just decided to stay in town, and is looking for him.  If the PCs tell Rose about her husband's death, she will understandably be upset, crying and sobbing. She will ask where the body is, and upon seeing it's state, will cry harder. She will calm down eventually and will ask that they bring it to the mortician to bury. She will thank the PCs and leave. If the PCs do NOT tell Rose where her husband is, she will leave town still looking for him. If Rose sees the body before being told about his death, she will scream and collapse upon the site of his mangled corpse. She will eventually calm and ask for help burying him
outcomes: 
  - The PCs tell Rose that her husband is dead, she will sob and cry and want to bury him. If the players attempt to find a way to help find a mortician or arrange a burial, she will insist that she can take care of this herself. 
  - The PCs decide not to tell Rose what happened to her husband, and she leaves without answers.
  - Rose sees her husbands body before being told, and has an emotional breakdown.
