The NPCs will start out sleeping as the Mountain Giants, they can stealth in and take the shard and leave if they choose or fight the Giants. If they grab the Shard and run, they can escape. If they choose to engage they will receive the Magic Item the Ring of the Champion from of the 5 Giants. This room is paying homage to the final fight where Faeolin Ironleaf fell fighting the True Giant they made him succumb to his wounds.
