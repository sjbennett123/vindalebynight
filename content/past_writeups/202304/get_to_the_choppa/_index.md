running_notes: This module will scale in its difficulty with how the players engage the Mausoleum itself. . Be careful with your PC group you pull for this about Floor 3 since the Black Unicorns have 3 Spellstrike Death’s and can deliver their 4 block as Magic.

rumors: |
  Adventurers, I have had a vision, Foereaver called out to me. I know where a piece of it is being kept that isn't in the hand of the Bloody Fist. Come ask me after the Mausoleum is reopened on the second day of the market this gather. I can give you its location but I won't post it here because the Bloody Fist might try to intercept. This weapon is something they fear, that is all I can say.
