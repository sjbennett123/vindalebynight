synopsis: >
  Two Tarrasch Black Pawns are set with a task. To take the body of Luca Norwish, now in pieces, to the town to be a statement piece. The goal is to display the body in the tavern, but if it is occupied, they will find an alternate site to place him On the body is pinned a note. 


  > “This is what happens to new blood in this town. Stay away”


  On both hands and on the heel of each foot the Tarrasch Symbol is drawn in blood. 
  
  The Pawns are kinda incompetent, carrying the body between them, a bag full of parts in hand. They argue between themselves, bickering over the best place to leave him, how they should display the body, the sounds he made while being sliced up, etc. They are careful, but not unduly so, counting on the late hour and darkness to hide them.  Once placed, the Pawns will congratulate themselves and go back to their hideout (NPC Shack).
