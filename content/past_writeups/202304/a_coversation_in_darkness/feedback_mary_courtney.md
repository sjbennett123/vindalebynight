 - This plot indicates the player will die if they don't accept the "Blessings" but then says they will get a brand. Is the idea to capture the player and give them no choice or is there a way to escape and NOT accept the "Blessings".
 - Is the brand a spirit mark.

## The Blessings of Murumbria

 - Morumbria is the place the Wraths are from and is spelled with an "o" "Morumbria"
 - Morumbrians are non-corporal but if they manifest out of body they are just shadows. However, they can take enough form to wear a cloak or cowl and their eyes will glow.
 - A person who willingly bonds to a Morumbrian is called an Umbriant. This is achieved with a special device that is phys repped as a box with a hole large enough to fit a hand in it and painted in black. They must put their hand in the hole and role play significant pain for at least a minute.
 - The scroll is s nice touch. If you wish to use the scroll, consider having the player recite it while their hand is in the box and when it is done, to shriek with pain.
 - An Umbriant can be "possessed" by the Morumbrian to influence and direct their will.  They will have benefits of strength and magic as plot decides when it is determined that their Morumbrian is manifesting.
 - A Wraith can inhabit hundreds of people and guide them as an army
 - If a Wraith decides to fully manifest through an individual they will be extremely powerful while the mainfestation is happening and when the Wraith pulls back, they will be dead and need to resurrect.
