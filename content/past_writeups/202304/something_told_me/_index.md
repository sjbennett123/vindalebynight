description: The Lord of the Woods appears in an ethereal form as a spawn point for his cultists who attempt to capture the players.  
Synopsis: > 
  This module starts as a Random but has a spawn point.  The Lord of the Woods has come out from a long winter of hiding and endless nightmares, awakening to the chaos of Orcs stomping around “His” woods now. He intends to make himself known so he appears to summon his loyal followers to enter town and seek new dreamers for his power to grow on, left unchecked and unchained his power will fluctuate out of control and he will grow even more mad and violent. The Lord of the Woods spawns in an ethereal state unable to be harmed surrounded in Eerie Green Light. This will be a visual effect of the module beginning and a way to get attention of the players to draw them out of the Tavern. Once they have taken notice of the Lord of the Woods, he will call a spawn of his Cultists while will spawn from his “Green Aura” once spawned or if the PCs approach too close the “Green Aura” will disappear and the current spawn will be live. When all NPC are killed, they will reform on the Lord of the Woods and respawn at different points around the camp until the amount of resets have been reached or 2 PCs have been captured. 


  If a PC is captured, they will be taken to the “Green Aura” of the Lord of the Woods and Rifted out on a normal 3 count to a secondary location where they will enter a roleplay encounter in a “Nightmare” included state where the Lord of the Woods  “harvest” dream energy from them and replace their dreams with “Nightmares” effectively giving them a “paranoia” effect till sunrise to grow his power and return their asleep body to a random spot on the campsite to wake up and rejoin the game.

outcomes: 
  - The PCs encounter the roaming encounter of the Cultists after seeing the weird floating green lights of the Lord of the Woods in the mists at the edge of the town in the treeline
  - The PCs ignore the eerie green lights and the Cultist roam the camp searching for people to “bring to the Lord” and grow increasingly aggressive with the longer it takes to find “willing” subjects
  - Players are captured by the lord of the woods cultisists and stricken with Paranoia

  A Message Posted on the Black Anvil Mercenary Scouting Watch Boards

  “Strange figures and eerie green lights have been reported at night in the woods to West of Stonewood. If you get close to them, their lights fade and nothing is there if you investigate. Sometimes you can make out only a figure: a tall humanoid with some kind of antlers of horns on his head, wrapped in leathers and furs, a large 2 handed blade over his back.“

Hook: Lord of the Woods appears at the edge of town from the Taverns door surrounded in eerie green lights, on him spawn a group of wondering Cultists
