title: Lord of the Woods Ethereal Form

description: Lord of the Woods
Layout: role

introduction: You were once a proud knight of the Verdant Hedge but for your crimes you were outcast from your realm. Though you didn’t do the crimes you were accused of, and your honor remained intact, your sanity snapped along the way along with your will to be the hero. Now you have not necessarily become the villain but the anti-hero and will stop it nothing to harvest enough Dream Energy to wage your war on the Verdant Hedge and get them back for ruining your honor as a Knight that was the most loyal soldier they knew now become Fear Incarnate.

Card: You have no Stats on this module. You are in an ethereal state and unable to hurt people or be hurt. The only power you have is to keep those asleep or unconscious in a dream-like state fueled with nightmares while you harvest their dream energy to fuel your war of revenge on the Verdant Hedge.

Master of Dreams: Anyone in a Sleep effect in your line of sight can be harvested of Dream Energy on a 3 count. This leaves the target with a “Paranoia” effect until the next Sunrise comes to wash away their fears. You are also lethargic as if woken from a Night Terror for the next hour in game (no game mechanic, purely RP). Even if they see the sunrise and get restful sleep they still feel your cold angry caress in their mind for a few days after they have been harvested on.

Eerie Green Aura: If you are brought within the Lord of the Woods “Eerie Green Aura” while he is Ethereal, on a 3 count he can rift you out on touch to a Dream-like realm where he can harvest your Dream Energy. Once you have been “Harvested” the Lord of the Woods will return you to a random spot on the campsite to wake up and rejoin the game.
