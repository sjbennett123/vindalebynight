 Val’Kaz really turned up the sinister game with this move. He wanted to hit Stonewood where It hurts, their pride. Orcamedes was ordered to construct him a vile insect that would burrow into the roots of the Stonewood Trees and poison them to wither them away. This would let  Val’Kaz watch the morale of the populate decay like the trees they hold so dead. The Gnawing Ones they were named, they are very effective in worker society and combat. Modeled after a termite for its wood destroying properties but genetically modified with varies other bug species to make them vicious and venomous.  

They cannot feel on the full grown stonewood but can feed on the younger stonewood that has not been time displaced yet. Once they have thier fill they hollow out huge caverns beneth the trees and lay their eggs which quickly mature into larvae.
