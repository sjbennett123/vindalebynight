There are three breeds of rats in the city

**Giant Field Rats** are primarily found around the farms and food stores. The Giant Field Rats want only to eat and multiply, and dislike fighting to the point where they will only attack if attacked first and they will defend one another if one is attacked.

**Sewer Rats** have primarily lived in the sewer, as the name suggests, but now are so prolific that they are moving into and are making the refuse site unsafe to use. These rats can cause weakness and disease if they get too close to someone, and if in a large group, they are aggressive and can be a threat.

**Bloody Rats** are field and sewer rats who have are now crazed. They have acquired a taste for blood and flesh somehow, and are not shy about getting it. In large groups, they have been known to even kill without provocation. If that wasn’t bad enough, they are now venturing close to town. The rats are are breeding at an extraordinary rate thanks to a mild winter, an early spring, and thousands of pounds of grain and other foodstuffs left over from the Orc army. The city did not know about the rat patrols, and didn’t know to continue them.

Bloody Rats are named such because their fur is usually matted with what people think is blood. No other difference has been observed between the aggressive rats and the non aggressive rats physically.
