introduction: A loyal citizen of Stonewood, you were among the first to be taken into chains when the Bloody Fist arrived. They tried to tell you how things were and you were not having it and you killed quiet a few before they stopped you and took you out of town unconscious as a captive. You remember the old days of proud Stonewood Dwarves and the conditions you returned under disgust you!

motivation: Restore Stonewood through trade and mercantile! The Bloody Fist oppressed your people and broke their will over a years’ time, this cannot stand and will be repaired. You were kept as a prisoner with most of the Guildmasters in less than hospitable conditions but they were manageable, you assumed you would be killed any day.

Let them feel the Guilds will stand will them against the wrath of the Bloody Fist.

**Not a fan of Mayor Durag AKA “Lil Bristle”:**  The only thing this clown has done is keep the people of Stonewood alive. Other than that he is a spineless coward you would like to see hung from the town square for treason against the 9 families. You will not be particularly quiet about this either. You are a proud Stonewood Dwarf and former military of Stonewood so you voice will be loud and clear about why he needs to be “retired”

**Your Old Friend Haddix:** Haddix served with you in the Stonewood military, finest archer Stonewood had seen in many years till the damn Bloody Fist severed his hand with some chaos tainted dagger and a weird ritual preventing its regrowth. You will always embrace this old friend when you see him in town. If anyone speaks ill towards him you will become very defensive and protective of your old brother in arms.
