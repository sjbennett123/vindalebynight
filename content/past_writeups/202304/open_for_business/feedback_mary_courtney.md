 - Missing details for how all the guilds will run and how players will use them
 - The Guild Name List seems to have cutters, scouts and rangers in separate guilds. This is not correct. As it says in the Stonewood dwarf culture packet, The Stonewood Woodcutters Guild is the guild responsible for managing the growth, marking, cutting, working and selling of Stonewood. Guild Specialists called Cutters, Rangers and Scouts handle each of these jobs within a single Guild, The Stonewood Woodcutters Guild.
 - The WoodCutters Guild has never really sold anything to players. It was just a presence in the town of Stonewood used for plot and roleplaying. However, if we want to provide some commerce, they could sell the T2 components that have a picture of Stonewood on them - and are already being put out as formal ritual components.
