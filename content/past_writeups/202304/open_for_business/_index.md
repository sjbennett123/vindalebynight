description: Faerune Leafdancer, Speaker of the Guilds, Voice of Runes Hammer has come to town to announce the reopening of the Guilds of Stonewood! In addition, there have been some additional guilds open to increase trade and prosperity across Stonewood and the greater Elysia during these trying times.
Requirements: Lunch Served
Synopsis: Many of the guild members were captured by the bloody fist but they are free now. Faerune Leafdancer goes over how the newly revised Guild structure will work in Stonewood. All of the new and existing guildmasters of Stonewood name are read. New guilds are established. A huge thank you to the Adventurers for bolstering the spirits of the citizens to spring those who were willing to fight to action in aiding Balor and Magnus to recover the missing Guildmasters. Also the Mausoleum of Fallen Heroes is to be opened as a training ground filled with foes from Stonewood past battles, rumor is a great treasure awaits those who can conquer the final level in one attempt this is detailed in the module "Unlucky 13".
Outcomes: The Guilds are reopened and the citizens of Stonewood are able to financial recover from the attacks of the Bloody Fist. Also the Adventurers will be able to access Guild supplies and workshops now
Hook: Faerune comes to town at Lunchtime to announce the return of the Guilds and gathers all in attendance.
Running Notes: This module is primarily a roleplay module. Reopening the Guilds allows the players to interact with them and production to be sold/traded for/requested/scrolls to be rented in Stonewood since this will be a major city in the plotline for years to come in Woodhaven. New guilds have been added to Stonewood to expand them as a trade city and line them up with Elysia more to make it more uniform when the Elysia wide guild system and guild passes come around allowing workshop access. Some of the local NPC guilds will remain NPC ran and controlled but the new and expanded guilds can change over time

  Message Posted on Town Square Common Board

  “Citizens and Residents of Stonewood! I am Faerune Leafdancer, formerly of the Stonewood military in my younger days and some of you may know me from my work locally with trade and mercantile. I would like to announce that all Guildmasters that the Bloody Fist had taken from Stonewood have been safely recovered, healed to full health, checked for enslavements, and had their spirits examined to make sure they can return to their duties. In brief, the Guilds of Stonewood will be fully reopened at Noon of this Markets gathering! I will be present to read the list of Guildmasters of the previously established guilds and the newly formed guilds so that we may expand our business ventures as proud Stonewood Dwarves!”

  I look forward to speaking with everyone at the Market gathering in 3 weeks,

  Faerune Leafdancer, Speaker of the Guilds, Voice of Runes Hammer
