title: A Dark Bargain with the Black Shadow
---

This tale has been repeated around the campfires of the Bloody Fist. A legend of their rebirth as a new horde.

*A few moons ago, a Shadowy Elf in Black Robes descended from the night sky before a very young orc named Ahroun. Ahroun rose to meet this man with cold steel but the Elf waved his hand and imprisoned him. The shadowy figure spoke to him “**If you give me your Tribe’s blood oath and fealty, I shall empower you with righteous vengeance that will shake the very existence of Elysia.**" Ahroun was but a young orc in the Great War 20 years ago but he remembered holding his dying father and brother who were cut down by Nobility of Stonewood. With burning hatred in his eyes, he accepted the offer of the robed man. Ahroun was freed but went through a terrifying transformation. Screaming till his eyes and mouth bled, he looked to the moon then down at a pool of water and saw he had Draconic features now and felt the presence of Celestial Magic in his blood.*
