 - After Bristle Bash
Synopsis:  >
  The Bloody Fist have obtained 2 high priority targets of Stonewood, Henant and Sir Tordex. They have beat and tortured them for information. The Bloody Fist wont enslave them because the Bloody Fist respect freedom and hate slavery, which is ironic considering they put Stonewood under their boot heels for over a year. 
  

   - Tordex was captured after about 7 days of scouting out Bloody Fist camps. Tordex has only been captured for about 3 days. Tordex luckily got most of his information back to a safe spot and his journals before his capture but has went radio silent for 3 days now. 
   - Henant was captured willingly to gather information on the Bloody Fist,  Henant has been captured the longer of the times about 7 days,The beating and torturing from Henant was much more personal given they have a much deeper past. Vel’Kaz personally took the banner Henant wears and told him to come get it back from him if he can. 
  
  
  Upon hearing the news of Selketh's failure to take the town, the Bloody Fist order Honor Guard orders the Transformed spirits to be stripped from the captives bodies. The Bloody Fist invoke a ritual to flay the spirit of their Totems from the captives. The players have 1 hour to save them from the ritual or their transform spirits will “flayed” from them. Using all their willpower to reach out, Henant and Tordex unconsciously reach their totems which have had trouble finding them and the spirits travel to Stonewood Tavern to gather other adventuers to rescue them.

  A Message Posted on the Black Anvil Mercenary Scouting Watch Boards

  Lately there have been sightings of large feline claw marks into trees near Stonewood on the Eastern side. Reports of skirmishes but not much is left but dead Bloody Fist Scouts and Orc blood everywhere. Sometimes there are drag marks for short or long distances but never consistent. Whatever this thing is, I am glad it is on our side.
