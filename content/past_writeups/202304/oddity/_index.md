Rumors: |
  “I have received a rather disturbing report from the Rangers Guild of Stonewood. There has been an odd disappearance as of late regarding various bugs in or around Stonewood. Not sure what this means for us, but it seems to be linked to something odd. According to Guildmaster Fuli Oakrider, the bugs most prominently missing are ones that can burrow and ones that feed on wood.”

Running_Notes: This module gives the players information on the Gnawing Ones and provides them the only True way to rid the caves of the Gnawing Ones as they are a Termite like incest but mutated and enhanced by Orcamedes. The Device given to them by Magnus Kane will be a one time use “Death Gas” on the Gnawing Ones if they set it off in a Cave on Saturday. If anyone remains in the Cave after the Fumigation Device is set off after 1 minute they will be struck with a “Death” effect should they stay in the Caves. This device would be detonated and they should leave the Banners infront of the Doors to trap the Gnawing Ones in the Caves while the Fumigation kills them. The gas will remain for 1 hour after it is set off so the players need to loot before they set off this device or they have 60 seconds to loot and run!
