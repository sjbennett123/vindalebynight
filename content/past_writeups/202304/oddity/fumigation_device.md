title: fumigation device
---

The Device given to them by Magnus Kane will be a one time use “Death Gas” on the Gnawing Ones if they set it off in a Cave on Saturday. If anyone remains in the Cave after the Fumigation Device is set off after 1 minute they will be struck with a “Death” effect should they stay in the Caves. This device would be detonated and they should leave the Banners infront of the Doors to trap the Gnawing Ones in the Caves while the Fumigation kills them. The gas will remain for 1 hour after it is set off so the players need to loot before they set off this device or they have 60 seconds to loot and run!
