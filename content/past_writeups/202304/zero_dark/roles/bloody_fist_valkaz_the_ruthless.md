title: Val’kaz the Ruthless, The Drinker of Fear
description: 

introduction: Your loyalty to the Bloody Fist is undying! Ahroun the Hopeflayer may not always approve of your less than honorable tactics but they get amazing results so he doesn't say much other than asking you to be more honorable in your methods. Ever since you could clutch a sword you were in the game of killing for sport and pleasure. People fear your name and avoid your eyes when you walk through town. No one dare question your methods, even if they seem unusually cruel or brutal. You are the one who makes nightmares for people to suffer when they try and escape your wrath.

motivation: Fear and Terror! Make Stonewood regret crossing the Bloody Fist. You will use every trick in the book from taking children to hanging their heroes on hooks to demoralize the people and adventurers of Stonewood into submission. Don't risk an open mob battle by yourself, let your Underlings fight and flee to the shadows to make actual kills as an assassin. Use the whole camp and DO NOT GET CAUGHT!!!!
