**Demand Obediance** - Demand that any outsiders that arrive follow the rules of the occupation. Reference how safe things are with the Changed Ones patrolling.

**Rude** - Whenever anyone is talking cut them off. Don't let them get in a word edgewise when they are speaking ot you. Walk away when you feel you have "won" the conversation.

**Cowardly** - If you are actually threatened in a meaningful way attempt to run. If that fails  plead. If that fails cry. You got to this place by your cowardice and if pressed that cowardice will come through.

**Shaved Beard** - You have had your beard shaved by the orcs because they think it's funny. They call you "Lil'Bristle" and laugh about it. You don't think it's very funny but you laugh along.

- Your best friend is Thorum Fairoak the town drunk. You guys go way back to when he ran his Jeweler Shop “Thorums Emporium”.  You will do anything for this guy!
  - He got you out of a lot of trouble when the Bloody Fist took over Stonewood. He knows you aren’t the best choice for Mayor but he talks you up saying you are doing ‘the best you can” and it has worked thus far.

- When the players show up to confront the Chosen Ones, you will do ANYTHING to talk them out of engaging them!
  - Beg them to lay down arms and follow the Accords of the Fist.
  - You don’t want any trouble with adventures because of how you sold them out last time to the Bloody Fist and they almost hung you for it.
