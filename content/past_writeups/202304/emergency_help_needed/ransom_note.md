  > Huldrek, how stupid can you be?
  > We want 75 Gold and the return of the rest of our treasure for the safe return of your grandmother.
  > Bring the gold and items to the drop point, alone.
  > Come to the drop point and call out "The Sicilian Dragon!" We will know you are there to parley.
  > We know you know about that adventuring scum in the city.
  > They need to stay out of this if you know what's good for you.
  > You have one hour.
