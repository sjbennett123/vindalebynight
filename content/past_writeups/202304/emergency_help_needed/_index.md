schedule: reaction
plotline: Family Recipes
requirements: Players find and take the Tarrasch treasure chest.

description: Huldrek gave up watching the Tarrasch's treasure chest and went back to his grandmother's house leaving the treasure chest undefended. Huldrek is found by the Tarrasch, beaten up, and commanded to find stolen Tarrasch treasure chest and get it back. A note encouraging speedy work and Granny bloody severed finger are delivered to Huldrek by a Tarrasch Pawn. 

synopsis: |
  The Tarrasch treasure has been stolen by player characters, and now the Tarrasch are angry. Huldrek put barely any effort into guard duty, and allowed the entire thing to be stolen. The Tarrasch quickly found Huldrek and beat him for information. He tells the Tarrasch what happened and that the adventurers in town have the treasure.
  Huldrek, beaten and bloody, is released to try and gather the treasure that was taken, including the box and all the trinkets,doodads, and treasure it contained. Huldrek honestly had no idea that the Tarrasch is a terror gang. He is adamant all he does is watch a box and deliver packages. While Huldrek is in town, a messenger is sent with a small box. Inside the box is a finger with a lock of gray “hair” tied around it and a ransom note. 
  
  
  Huldrek ramps up his panic and beg for help. He is against any plan except just taking the coin and treasure to the location alone. It takes convincing or being threatened for him to go along with any other plan.   Once a plan is agreed upon, Huldrek follows along with the plan. This module directly leads into THE EXCHANGE.  

outcomes: 
  - The players go to meet the Tarrasch and the module The Exchange is ran. 
  - The PCs run out of time, and find the body of Granny at the ransom drop off point. THIS IS A TIMED MOD. Mod failure occurs one hour after Huldrek gets the note.
