description: Quest for reforging Foereaver, Faeloin Ironleaf’s weapon for Balor 
---

Faeloin Ironleaf, a legendary hero of Stonewood, his dying act was slaying a Greater Undead True Giant in a last Hope battle for Stonewood. Faeolin, succumbed to his wounds as he drove his family heirloom axe “Foereaver” into the heart of the beast. The shards of Foereaver were stolen from Balor during the Bloody Fist occupation, his personal quest is to reclaim the shards of Foereaver and drive it into the heart of their leader “The Hope Flayer.” The spot Faeolin died was where the Mausoleum of Fallen Heroes was built in his honor. Balor Ironleaf is his strongest living descendant and the only one who can reforge Foereaver to its true power. Balor works to restore Stonewood to the glory of his ancestor Faeolin’s vision and honor. 7 pieces of Foeraver are needed to be able to reforge it to its status. They will be located in the Mausoleum and other side quests 

I had envisioned them as the Shards of Andruil, useless until reforged but  if they are reforged by the bad guys it would be horrible. The weapon is the key to making Ahroun killable. His spirit will just rage revive unless he is killed by this weapon. He is kind of like a lich in that regard and this shattered his soul from the Black Shadows power and allows him to be at peace with death
