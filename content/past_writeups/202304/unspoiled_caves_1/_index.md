description: Adventurers attempt to exterminate the Gnawing Ones who have infested the root system of some of the trees of Stonewood by using a Fumigation Device provided by the Rygel Order in the module "Oddity". This Cave is the first in the series, Bloody Rats are skulking around the cave and hiding from the Gnawing Ones while looking for some Orc blood to feed on.

Synopsis: > 
 This is 1 of 10 modules, increase in  difficulty both in terms of what they will fight but more importantly HOW they will fight. Each Cave has a Bloody Fist Banner at the entrance of the Cave, just inside the Mod shack door. The Banners are VERY important to these modules, the Gnawing Ones are afraid of the Banners. They will not advance past them or at you if you brandish a Bloody Fist Banner. The players may move the wooden base with the Bloody Fist Banner through the Cave to “control” the way the Gnawing Ones engage the Players. The Gnawing Ones will not leave the Caves to pursue the players under any circumstances. 



outcomes:
  - The PCs will enter the Cave to engage the Gnawing Ones and defeat them to stop their destruction of the Stonewood Trees from the roots. Once they are all dead they set off a Fumigation Device to prevent that Tree from being infected further and allow it to heal. 
  - The PCs fail to stop the Gnawing Ones and they continue to gnaw away and the Stonewood Roots to destroy them with enough time
