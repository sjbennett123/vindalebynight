title: gnawing ones lore 
---

Val’Kaz really turned up the sinister game with this move. He wanted to hit Stonewood where It hurts, their pride. Orcamedes was ordered to construct him a vile insect that would burrow into the roots of the Stonewood Trees and poison them to wither them away. This would let  Val’Kaz watch the morale of the populate decay like the trees they hold so dead. The Gnawing Ones they were named, they are very effective in worker society and combat. Modeled after a termite for its wood destroying properties but genetically modified with varies other bug species to make them vicious and venomous.  

They cannot feel on the full grown Stonewood trees but can feed on the younger Stonewood that has not been time displaced yet. Once they have their fill they hollow out huge caverns beneath the trees and lay their eggs which quickly mature into larvae. 

The Gnawing Ones are afraid of the Banners of the Fist. They will not advance past them or at you if you brandish a Bloody Fist Banner. 

The Gnawing Ones have a special way they kill you, they wont drop you and begin a killing blow count like most monsters or players will. They want you to be paralyzed and helpless so they can look you in the eyes when they push their claws into your heart and feel the fear gush out onto them as you bleed out on their chitinous exoskeletons.
