synopsis: Balar distributes the zine "Notes and Observations on the Bloody Fist" that he and the Black Anvil Company have collected. He also reviews the notes that he has on the Spirit Bomb that the Orcs are preparing. He is worried that the orcs will complete their work soon. He will have the same energey as Bruce Banner in Avengers Endgame concerned with the arrival of thanos. Terrified with the nature of the force that the orcs have assembled. He also speaks to a seemingly unrelated series of murders that are tied to a symbol that looks like a shepards crook and he will produce an example and provide it to the players. 

outcomes: 
  - Adventurers are able to go on the Unspoiled Caves and Knee Deep Camp Modules.

  Adventurers and Allies of the United Stonewood Effort, 

  I hope your Winter was not too unbearable. The good Baron Hadukkel has begun efforts to fortify us against the inevitable Bloody Fist attack in 3 weeks time. We at the Black Anvil Mercenary Company will do what we can to assist him and Stonewood. Our scouts and soldiers, at great costs during the Winter months, have gathered a collection of our best knowledge of the Bloody Fist and will be delivering it you once the Adventurers have been gathered at Markets beginning. We believe this information will be critical in knowing the nature of the enemy are facing. This battle will not be resolved in a matter of days. Orcs love to wage war for an extended period of time, if we can cut at least one head off this hydra then we can buy ourselves time till the next strikes.

  Be safe and bring your best weapons and healers, Tyrras grace we will need them,

  Balor Ironleaf
  Captain and Guildmaster of the Black Anvil Mercenary Company
