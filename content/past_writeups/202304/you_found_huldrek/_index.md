Layout: module

author: Brittney Perry
reviewer: Scott Bennett
weight: 16
schedule: saturday early afternoon
plotline: Family Recipes
requirements: The module "Operation Find Huldrek" was not ran. 

description: Huldrek, the grandson of Granny Silverlode has turned up at the tavern being a rude, loud, and obnoxious drunk. Huldrek is not allowed in the tavern. 

synopsis: > 
  Huldrek, unable to take sobriety any longer, has abandoned his post guarding the Chest of the Tarrasch in the woods. He turns up in the tavern, unarmed, being a loud and disorderly drunk. He isn't mean or threatening, he is just looking for a few drinking buddies and a card game. Every so often, Huldrek drops hints as to his identity. Eventually, he will either- get recognized from the “Help Wanted” ad OR escalate his bragging, boasting, and thinly veiled insults to the point were he has to bribe his way out of being beaten. Either way, he will offer to take the PCs to the Tarrasch Chest in exchange for letting him go back to his Granny's, unharmed. He will also use/ offer the map in his pocket.
  If he is beaten down and searched, another map is found, this one with clear instructions to the chest. 
  If Huldrek is stunned, webbed, or otherwise captured, he will do his best to convince the PCs to allow him to go free in exchange for taking the PCs to the Tarrasch treasure and for the map in his pocket.
  
outcomes: 
  - Huldrek is recognized from the HELP WANTED module, and is captured or convinced to go back to his Granny. Huldrek tells/shows the PCs the location of the treasure to let him go unharmed.
  - Huldrek becomes unbearable and is threatened. Instead of a fight, Huldrek offers to pay the PCs with the Tarrasch treasure to allow him to go.
  - Huldrek is beaten down and is searched. An map to the Tarrasch Chest is found in his pocket and/ or is left behind when he resurrects.
  - If Huldrek returns to his Granny unaccompanied by PCs and the PC's don't have the map before collection of the reward, Granny will give the PCs the map and the reward stating, eg. “He doesn't need directions to wherever this leads because he wasn't leaving the house for a month!”
