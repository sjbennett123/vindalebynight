description: former Towns Guard of Stonewood, now Mayors Aide
introduction: You used to be a proud Town Guard of Stonewood but the Bloody Fist stripped you of your job! You were a Dwarf of common birth, but your deeds earned you a place on the guard. You never were the best in a fight, but your skills with words earned you respect among your comrades. Mayor Anak felt awful your job was erased by the Bloody Fist via the Accords, so as compensation he made you his personal aide to the Town of Stonewood which you have conflicted views on but its better than being broke.

**Right Hand Man**: You got stuck in an entry level job with a massive glass ceiling. Your boss, Mayor Anak is a total jerk and not the most liked person, but it pays the bills and the Bloody Fist don’t bother you so its “ok” living.

- You CANNOT STAND Mayor Anak’s best friend Thorum! You think he is such and idiot and more of a coward than Anak is. The man was set for life, and he rolled it all away on dice when he could have taken over a jewelry empire in Stonewood. You only tolerate him cause the Mayor loves this man, but if the Bloody Fist cut his tongue out you would buy them a drink on you.

**Hype Man**: Whatever offers the mayor makes, up the ante if they PCs don’t accept it. You probably can’t make them come true but by morning the Bloody Fist will be here and can handle the players themselves.

- You don’t hate the Bloody Fist with a burning passion like you used to when the Town Guard was dismantled at first. But you certainly have no real love for them. You secretly want the Bloody Fist gone but you don’t have the heart to fight them or risk the whole town's lives to go back to being a poor excuse for a Town Guard in Stonewood. You can be swayed to either side by the PCs.
  - As a former guard you respect their position as protectors of Stonewood in a way. It is hard to explain but you justify it in your head, and it makes sense to you why it is comfortable. Mostly because you weren’t the best fighter, you preferred words to the blade. You don’t like how brutal they are when they execute punishments. There is no grey area with the Bloody Fist. You either obey or you pay, normally with your life but they can be reasoned with for components and gold piles.
- When the players enter the town on Friday night, meet them with Mayor Anak in the road and try to convince them to leave Stonewood! You don’t want any trouble and the Bloody Fist would surely crush them like they did the last.  Try to convince them that life is good under the Accords of the Fist! Hand the players a copy of the Accords of the Fist and beg them to read it out to the others to see reason.
