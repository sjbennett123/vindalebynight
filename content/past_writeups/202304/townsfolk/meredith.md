introduction: You were once an avid Adventurer known for your hunting of Werewolves and Vampires. But an injury you sustained on a rather vicious hunt left you unable to continue your life of fighting the creatures of the night. Though with this injury came the gift of prophecy. You now travel Woodhaven attempting to divine the fortunes of adventurers for a coin to make a living. Sometimes the readings are nothing more than filling them with hope, but sometimes they are terrifying possessions from beyond the Veil of this realm and into the unknown…

- When reading a PCs fortune, ask lots of questions about their past. The bigger the responses from the player, engage them with a dark prophecy. These will be unique descriptive phrases given by plot to hint at events to come

 **When the dark prophecies take over:**

Touch the players arm and close your eyes. Start to mutter nonsense to yourself and open your eyes dramatically. Change your voice to much deeper and distort it so it sounds like someone else talking

To the most engaged players who you give readings to, hand out the following Dark Prophecies:

“*I see the Town of Stonewood ablaze, Orcish laughter echoes as you hear your friends screaming for help. Nothing can save you from the pain that is coming. Embers are already lit but they will raise to bonfires after sunset”*

*I see a mausoleum, dark, cold, and filled with life. But the life is not recent life, this life has been forcible brought back against its will and it is FURIOUS to be here. You must cease it before it gives into hatred”*

*“I see 3 dead bodies laying at the foot of Bloody Fist assassins, they have crossed over spiritually but their bodies are here forever, the smell of sulfur is potent in the air, the town is falling apart, and you didn’t save them in time”*

*“I see clouds of green mist, smoke, decay, and hear hideous laughter echoing as your cling to your consciousness and breathe. The room is shrinking by the second as well”*

*“I see the shadows are animating, they dance to life and are looking for something or someone. They are incredible angry and determined”*

- If you read the fortune of the “chosen one” (ask Plot to tell you who) when you grab their arm to tell them the dark prophecy, Scream and pass out for a minute on the table. You mind is overwhelmed by a horrific nightmare they have been experiencing for weeks now:

*The dream begins with you being held cradled like a baby by a gigantic figure in dark robes. Held close to it’s chest you cannot see it’s face. You are not comforted by this action despite the apparent kindness of the gesture. The figure’s skin is cold and it’s movement is stiff and emotionless. A cold purple light pervades the room glowing in intensity then you wake up. When you wake up you are covered in sweat and cannot shake the feeling of doom.*
