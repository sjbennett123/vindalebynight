Synopsis: > 
  This module is the execution of Mayor Durag in a honor combat form. Mayor Durag enters the tavern for a drink of his Bristle Brock, but unknowing to him Loken Oakrider followed him to publicly challenge him to a contest of Dwarven Might for his title of Mayor, in the Old Ways of Stonewood. The terms of the combat are No Magic, Just Strength of Arms. Any Stonewood Dwarf worth his salt would not back down from such a serious challenge, but Mayor Durag plays his age and injuries and elects for the Rite of a Champion. Not surprised by this cowardly choice, Loken grants him 30 minutes to name, find his champion, and return to the Tavern for the Duel to take place so that Honor may be settled.
  
   Mayor Durag brings a Bloody Fist Honor Guard for his champion, securing his downfall either way. Upon Durag’s death he Transforms to a Alpha Pantherghast Dwarf, a hold is called and the NPCs  swap out for a “Transformed” Alpha Panthergast version of Mayor Durag. Friday night after refusing the terms of Welcome to OrcTown, as a final insult to Durag and his submissiveness to the Fist, Vel’Kaz ordered that a transformation ritual be case upon Mayor Durag because he knew Mayor Durag was on borrowed time.  A group of Bloody Fist waited for Mayor Durag at his house and forced a Curse of Transformation Alpha Pantherghast on Mayor Durags spirit and then Forget-It-Well his memory so he doesn’t remember the act but he knows what is on his spirit. When he woke up he had a note on his chest “Tell no one about your spirit changing or your whole town DIES!!!! And the letter was signed ~V
outcomes: 
  - Loken will challenge Mayor Durag and defeat his champion, the execution of Mayor Durag will be left to Loken but he will defer the sentencing to Baron Hadukkel…. If Mayor Durag is killed he transforms into an Aplha Pathergast.
  - Loken is defeated and Durag chooses to “spare” Loken as a sign of good faith since he was trying to do the right thing but obviously the spirits weren’t on his side.

  Rumor Circulating the Town

  “A Dwarf with the likeness of one of Stonewoods original heroes has been seen around town. Though his clothing and weapons may have changed, there is no mistaking his Red beard and his helmet. His voice inspires courage and confidence in those around him. Though he was thought to be long dead or moved onto Golden Halls, Loken Oakrider was his name. If this really is Loken, then the Bloody Fist are in for a world of pain!”
