### The Need for the Chosen One

They inform the Chosen One they need a tie here for the Hoyleans might win in the future and come back to this point in time as corrupted Light zealots (this is the reason that Hoyle here was destroyed so easily, the war in the future summoned them all away 3 years ago)
The Chosen One can accept the Blessing of Murumbria or deny it. If the player denies it, The Dark Ones will forcibly Spirit Mark the Chosen One with unique brand that will fade by morning by allows them to tether to this realm. 

### The Brand of Morumbria

The Dark Ones will forcibly Spirit Mark the Chosen One with unique brand that will fade by morning by allows them to tether to this realm. 

### The Time War

The Dark Ones are 3 immortal beings of pure Darkness (they cannot be harmed bye or harm a PC). They have names that normal people cannot understand. They only speak telepathically to mortals. If you heard their true voices, then you might explode from the raw magical power. 
The Dark Ones want to capture the Chosen One so they have an anchor to this version of Woodhaven for the coming war when it kicks off. 
The Hoyleans from their time are winning and they need to make a power play and shift the battlefield to a place where they are losing, and their power is weaker. The Hoyleans from the Murumbrian future have become ultra-Light zealots and seem to be corrupted by hate from their true purpose.
