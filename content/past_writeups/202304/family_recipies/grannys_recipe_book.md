# Yotaere's Award Winning Chocolate Cake

## Ingredients

- 6 tablespoons unsalted butter, plus more for greasing the pan
- 2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting the pan
- 2 teaspoons baking powder
- 2 teaspoons baking soda
- 1 teaspoon kosher salt
- 2 cups sugar
- 2 cups water
- 4 ounces unsweetened chocolate, chopped
- 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
- 2 eggs, lightly beaten
- Chocolate Frosting (see Note)

## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 350°F. Butter and flour two 8- x 1 1/2-inch round cake pans. Line bottoms of pans with parchment paper. Sift together flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a medium bowl; set aside.
2. Combine sugar with 2 cups of water in a medium saucepan. Bring to a boil over high heat and stir until sugar dissolves; pour into a large bowl. Add chocolate and butter and let sit, stirring occasionally, until melted and slightly cooled, about 15 minutes. Stir in vanilla.
3. Beat eggs into chocolate mixture by hand or at medium speed with an electric mixer, until combined. Add dry ingredients all at once and beat at medium speed until smooth. Divide batter evenly between the prepared pans and bake until top springs back when pressed lightly and a cake tester comes out clean, about 25 minutes. Cool cakes in their pans for 25 minutes, then invert onto a rack to cool completely.
4. Set one cake, right-side up, on a serving platter. Using a metal spatula, spread one-third (about 1 1/4 cup) of the Chocolate Frosting evenly over cake. Top with second cake and frost top and sides with remaining frosting.
