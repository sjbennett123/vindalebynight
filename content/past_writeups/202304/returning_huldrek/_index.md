synopsis: Huldrek, at some point, gets himself caught and returned to his Grandmother. He refuses to speak in her presence, and really, Granny doesn't let him even try. She interrupts him whenever he tries to speak, chastising him. She insists he turn out his pockets and give his money to the PCs because “he can't be trusted with it”. If Huldrek has any coin left, it is given to the PCs and the reward difference made up by Granny. When he turns out his pockets, if he still has it, he will turn out a map that is quickly grabbed by Granny and handed over to the PC's. If the map is already possessed by the PCs, she finds nothing else and will ask that they leave so that she can properly scold her Grandson.

running_notes: Scene Description -Upon entering Granny's home, the PCs are greeted with a warm, homely scent. The house is well kept and quaint, full of soft pillows and flower print. It appears to be the home of someone who lives comfortably. Nothing has changed since HELP WANTED. Huldrek should refuse to talk or talk minimally if he is with Granny. Granny should talk over Huldrek whenever he speaks. Granny is stubborn and will deny any wrong doing by Huldrek. Granny will pay and then kick out the PCs if they insist on bringing up any wrong doing by Huldrek. If Huldrek is carrying any money,  it should be given to the PCs and the difference made up, if there is one, to amount to 10 silver.
