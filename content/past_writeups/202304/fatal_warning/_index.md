reviewer: Scott Bennett, Mary Courtney


Requirements: 
- Both Fears by Torchlight and Torchlight Boogloo modules have ran
Synopsis: > 
  This is the final warning of the Bloody Fist before the Fire Drakes are summoned. All named Townsfolk enter the town with pamphlets outlining an evacuation protocol for the citizens of Stonewood. The pamphlets seem to be a humane request for innocents to leave before this escalates but the wording is grim for what is to come.  


  4-5 named NPC enter the Tavern reading the Bloody Fist pamphlets to themselves in confusion and fear. 3 Bloody Fist Scouts enter unarmed with hands up, these Scouts are just delivering more pamphlets and then leaving. A large scene will erupt in the Tavern as the townsfolk are enraged for different reasons. 

  This roleplay encounter will setup the module "The Ritual of Fire. Each NPC will give different talking points and try to bring the players to different conclusions. At the climax of this scene Durmac will make a triumphant statement and storm out of the Tavern to go speak with the Bloody Fist only to find an assassin waiting for him to stab a pamphlet to his chest and kill him for his defiance.

Outcomes:
 - The players are given the pamphlets by other NPCs or roaming Scouts with no weapons. They arenâ€™t here to fight; they have come to deliver a message.
 - The Ritual of Fire proceeds as announced in the pamphlets

Hook: All Named townsfolk come to the Tavern with these pamphlets in hand, Scouts follow them to distribute them.

rumors: |
  The Ritual of the Fire Drakes has been gifted by the Black Shadow to the Bloody Fist Orcs. This ritual allows the orcs to summon the Baleful Fire Drakes. These fearsome creatures are green and red Fire Drakes from the Fire Plane. They are morphed into Draconic looking figures because of the influence of the Black Shadow on the ritual. They are incredibly destructive and follow the orders of those who summoned them to complete their task or scorching things. They breathe a fire that will burn anything. They are fast moving and do not speak just grunt and growl.
