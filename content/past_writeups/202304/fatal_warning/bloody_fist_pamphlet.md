> Read this carefully as it may save your life or the life of a relative or friend. In the next few hours, this city will be destroyed by the mighty magic of the Bloody Fist. This city has proven to be a military target that stands against the Bloody Fist with workshops and factories that are turned against the peace that the Bloody Fist brings. We are determined to destroy all of the tools of the military clique which they are using to prolong this useless war. But, unfortunately, magic has no conscience. So, in accordance with the Bloody Fist's humanitarian policies, the Bloody Fist Mages, which do not wish to injure innocent people, now give you warning to evacuate the city and save your lives. The Bloody Fist is not fighting your population people but is fighting the military clique which has enslaved you. The peace which the Bloody Fist will bring will free the people from the oppression of the military clique.
