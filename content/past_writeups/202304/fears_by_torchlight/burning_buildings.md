title: Burning Buildings
---



The Goal is to have the Scouts perform a 30 count (20 to Douse with Oil and 10 to burn with Torch) to set buildings on fire. If the Scouts get 6 Buildings “On Fire” before the PCs can stop them then the failure condition is reached for the PCs. The Tavern is large enough it can be set on fire twice. It counts as 2 objectives if 2 different teams set it on fire at different points, it will be fully ablaze. When a building is on fire, the Scout will loudly announce “X BUILDING IS ON FIRE!” where X is the building they set. “Surrender or Burn” pamphlets come shortly after this with the threat of the Ritual of Fire!
