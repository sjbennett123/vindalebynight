description: Loken “Bloodhammer” Oakrider, a hero of the Underdark War and of old Stonewood has been sighted around town lately. People thought he had been long dead or moved onto Golden Halls. With the Rebirth of the Bloody Fist, this living legend has re-emerged into Stonewood but something is different this time…
requirements: Know Your Enemy and Ripped Apart have both been ran.
Synopsis:  Loken Oakrider was a renowned hero in Old Stonewood before it was properly settled into the Barony of Woodhaven under the Duchy of Elysia. There was a great and terrible war with the Underdark and Loken was among the last standing Dwarven Generals when the Dryder Queen was defeated. Beyond most peoples memory, Loken has re-emerged from his retirement as a great Foe threatens Stonewood once again that has the potential to rival that of the Underdark War…. But there is one problem… Loken shouldn’t be in as good of health as he is…

Outcomes:
  - Loken will enter the tavern and question the adventures about Mayor Durag and his vile deeds. He will attempt to push the adventurers into action and bolster morale of the people in Stonewood from this bowing down that was “agreed upon” He will promise to “set the Mayor” straight on Saturday…
  - The PCs will reject Lokens push for assistance in dealing with the Mayor as they might feel he would destabilize the Town further.

  Rumor Circulating the Town

  “A Dwarf with the likeness of one of Stonewoods original heroes has been seen around town. Though his clothing and weapons may have changed, there is no mistaking his Red beard and his helmet. His voice inspires courage and confidence in those around him. Though he was thought to be long dead or moved onto Golden Halls, Loken Oakrider was his name. If this really is Loken, then the Bloody Fist are in for a world of pain!”
Hook: Loken enters the Tavern for a drink and to gather information to deal with the situation of Stonewood
Props: Loken Oakrider Costuming
Running_Notes: This is a purely RP module introducing a character intertwined into the Bloody Fist plot and the Hoylean-Murumbrian Time War plot. Lokens purpose is to unite the people of Stonewood and remove Mayor Durag by any means necessary as he has foreseen the downfall of Stonewood if Mayor Durag is not removed before Vel’Kaz the Ruthless arrives to town. Loken has a set of hidden powers linked to Time that he wont reveal unless things are getting to out of hand and it risks making the timeline worse by not intervining.
