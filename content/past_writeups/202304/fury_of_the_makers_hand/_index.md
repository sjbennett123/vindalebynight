author: Chris Colland
reviewer: Mary Courtney
tagline: One day the tides will turn, one day the fields will burn, one day the seas will churn, the fury of our makers hand! 
description:  Orcamedies grand design has come to fruition and the Bloody Fist Bomb is about to detonate! Now it is a race against time to put the charged pieces of the bomb together and quell the effects of this hellish deisgn.
Requirements: Camps and Cave Modules have been ran
Synopsis:  The players will be in possession of 1-10 charged pieces of the bomb, depending on how many they have will determine how potent the bomb will be. But they must fight up a grueling hill to the bomb site to assemble the outer shell pieces they have to contain the “blast” Orcameides has stored inside it. There is no way to fully stop the bomb at this point, but it can be “contained”
Outcomes: (1) The players reach the bomb and put the pieces on the bomb to “minimize” the effects of it (2) The players don’t reach the bomb in time, and it detonates at full strength releasing the psychic attack Orcameides has prepared for Stonewood.

Hook: Magnus Kane comes to town with a message he received from a Rygal scout that the bomb site has been found and that is no time to waste!

Running Notes: This module is a huge grinder fight from the road in front of tavern to the Bomb Site. The PCs will face wave after wave of Bloody Fist troops as they push their way up the hill to the Bomb Site through heavily defended lines of troops. This will not be an easy fight for anyone. NPCs will move back behind the current line of battle and reset on a 3 count as reinforcements move in. The count and speed of this fight will be determined on the aggressiveness of the PCs. If they faulter and waste time the Orcs will keep coming, if they push when they down each wave then the fight will be shorter as they push to the Bomb Site quicker. When they arrive Orcs will still attack while the PCs “assemble” the bomb outer shell to weaken the “blast” then they can flee before it detonates if they have time left.
rumors: |
  I came across a large clearing in the woods that wasn’t here last week. It seems oddly specific in the layout, drawings in the dirt don't make much sense as to what they are doing here. My best guess would be some future forward camp site. There doesn’t seem to be any indication of ritual markings or preparations yet but who knows with these Orcs. I have encountered Orcs who have cast Celestial magic before but it seems like they have help from some kind of entity that has an Arcane edge over magic. I hope this is just a forward camp site, but my gut tells me this might be something else. You have to see this place in the daylight, at night time you would miss it and mistake it as a clearing in the forest.

  Your Friend in the Darkness,
