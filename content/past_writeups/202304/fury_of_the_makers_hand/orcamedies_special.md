title: The Orcamedies Special
---



 

·    The “The Orcamedies Special” is a creation by Orcamedies the Mad, an Orc inventor trapped inside a Skull

·    The bomb was created to incite fear and panic, but the true purpose of the bomb is to psychically attack the minds of the people in Stonewood and make them sympathetic to the Orcish cause! The suffering and hunting to almost extinction the Bloody Fist faced almost 20 years ago will never be forgotten, just because Orcs are “Humans” “Elves” and “Dwarves” doesn’t mean they deserve genocide in the eyes of Oracmedies. 

·    The players will have 10 “charged” pieces of the bomb shell they can recover depending on how they choose to tackle the weekend. If the players obtain the following amounts of “charged” pieces of the bomb by stopping the rituals at the Bloody Fist Stonewood Tree Camps they will reduce the bomb by:

o  If the players obtain 3 “charged” pieces of the bomb, the effects will be reduced by 25%

o  If the players obtain 6 “charged” pieces of the bomb, the effects will be reduced by 50%

o  If the players obtain 9 “charged” pieces of the bomb, the effects will be reduced by 75%

o  If the players obtain 10 “charged” pieces of the bomb, the effects will be reduced by the maximum amount possible and one of the “charged” bomb pieces will become a magic item that will be delivered to the players found by Magnus after the bomb detonates imbedded in a Stonewood Tree

·    When the module starts, the PCs will be told they have 45 minutes to reach the bombsite and assemble the outer shell to reduce the effects. A mod Marshall will set a time when lay on is called and call a hold when the timer is done.

·    Players that are caught in the immediate area (Will be clearly marked on the ground where the blast radius/formal circle is at entrance of Mod) hit with 2 Formal Magic Backlash Effects at once! 

o  The first effect is **“****92 - 96 5% Primary caster becomes an idiot, unable to use any skills, for one hour.”**

o  The Second effect is **“55 1% All limbs of all in the circle in which the Formal is being cast are withered as per the spell, may be restored”**

o  These effects are per the Formal Magic Backlash chart on page 18 of the Formal Book

o  When the bomb detonates, there won’t be much of a sound, the bomb is more of a silent EMP Psychic attack but a shockwave will be felt for miles around the ritual site.

·    This bomb is mainly designed to effect the minds of the NPCs in the town of Stonewood and the surrounding areas. The PCs will as adventurers is far stronger than so the effects don’t harm them as badly as the NPCs

·    PC or NPC, if any amount of time is spent in the “Stonewood Crater” after the bomb has detonated, the bombs lingering “psychic radiation” will began to change and warp their sanity and spirit into something darker….
