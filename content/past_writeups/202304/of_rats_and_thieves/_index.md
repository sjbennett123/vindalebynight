synopsis: > 
  Luca Norwish,a friendly adventurer, is looking for a party to adventure with. He and his wife have traveled to Stonewood looking for fortune. He has with him a message from a farmer, looking for someone to help him clear out a rat pack that is eating his seed grain. The PCs go to the farm and are greeted by Gerald, the farmer. He explains that he has a large bag of seed grain for spring planting, and the rats are strongly attracted to it. He can no longer manage them on his own and is so glad that the PCs are there. Gerald leads them to a room where to Giant Rats are.

  The Rats meander around the room occasionally going to the bag of grain. The Giant Rats do not attack unless they are attacked first or the grain bag is disturbed. The farmer encourages the PCs to kill the docile rats. Once the rats are slain, Gerald goes into the room and makes sure they are all dead. All the cast members that played as rats gather outside and change costumes The cast members then respawn as the Tarrasch. Gerald turns to face the doorway so the PCs backs are to the door. Gerald, the farmer, thanks the PCs and inspects the leftover grain. While doing this he makes small talk and explains the rat tail bounty that the SCPSD has put in place. As the PCs are talking to the farmer, the Tarrasch storm into the room and incapacite the players. Once the PCs are down, they are searched for magic items, money and rat tails. These items are kept on the Bishop until end of event. Luca is abducted, the rest are stabilized and left with a note or a bloody mark. The farmer is caught in the crossfire and dies.
