Synopsis: >
  The Lord of the Woods sent his Cultists to a set of houses just outside of Stonewood proper. Forthe Cromel and Serath Cromel a brother and sister were taking a walk at night. The two were set upon by Cultists and while the siblings managed to kill a few cultists but were overran. The siblings fled but did not realize that this was all a part of the cultists plan. The Cultists were herded the siblings down a set path to lure them to “the Cave” that the Cultist use to trap victims. 
  
  
  Forthe Cromel set some makeshift traps and held the advance of the off, Serath Crome wrote a note and attempted to make a break for it but one was captured and “Harvested” by the Lord of the Woods and returned to “the Cave” hold up in a small passageway, they await hope as a cultist took the message recklessly and went towards town with greed in their eyes.
  
  
  This module starts out as a random encounter. One of the 5 Cultists has a Map to “the Cave” north of Stonewood that the siblings are holed up in. The PCs loot the map upon defeating the roaming Cultists then are free to engage in this module how they wish. They can 
  
  
  1. gather a team and hunt the Cave down to save them
  
  2. Go alone or small squad to rescue them
  
  3. ignore the map completely and write it off which the Lord of the Woods kills the siblings just before Sunrise.
  
  
  The Siblings hold the location of where the “Vine people” have been sighted coming and going from but can only take them there in the daytime, too unsafe at night and hard to find. They also overheard the Lord of the Woods Cultists speaking about a group called the “Circle of Blackened Thorns”.
outcomes: 
 - The PCs fight the roaming Cultist and find the note and pursue the map to the cave to rescue the siblings
 - The PCs choose to ignore the map or don’t pursue the map the siblings are killed at just before Sunrise by the Lord of the Wood

  A Message Posted on the Black Anvil Mercenary Scouting Watch Boards

  “Movements at night time of what appear to be Wild Elves and Barbarians mostly, a few Humans among them, have been spotted to the West of Stonewood. If you get close to them, they will stop and stare at you but wont advance unless you do. Speaking with them has not gained much result yet, they seem to me stalking something or seeking something. The most distinguishing marks we can find of them is that they have Black and Green markings on their faces in the shape of vines and leaves.”

Hook: Roaming Cultists appear in town with map as loot on one of them
