Information: 
1) The Siblings hold the location of where the “Vine people” have been sighted coming and going from but can only take them there in the daytime, too unsafe at night and hard to find. 
2) They also overheard the Lord of the Woods Cultist about a group called the “Circle of Blackened Thorns” that is linked to the Lord of the Woods they think but no other information. The Circle of Blackened Thorns can be explained if the PCs bring this topic up to Magnus Kane of the Rygal Order as he has encountered them before.
