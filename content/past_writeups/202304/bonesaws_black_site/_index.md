running_notes: This module is a module on pause until triggered by a capture. Bonesaw is an especially cruel jailor and will demand blood sacrifices made to send a message. Set the camp up so there is only one real approach to getting in. If outside, tie the captured up with a rope/chain prop to something. The rope/chain can be undone with a key on Bonesaw’s body. The players can kill Bonesaw or drop him and search him for the key. If he is killed he is dead, the remainder rescue mods won’t have Bonesaw but will be filled in with more Bloody Fist Grunts/Shaman. The Shamans focus on keeping Bonesaw alive to keep the player sin a stat of panic and disorder.  If more than 5 rescues are used the next will have a Raid Leader and 3 Honor Guard as a high threat trap to get more when they come. This will be a capture trap module, but the Honor Guards will be KBA as per their normal card and MO.

  Bonesaw the Jailor is known for his brutal ways of blood sacrifice. Some don’t care for  for the levels he will go to prove his devotion but his favor with Ahroun means he cannot be challenged. The warlord favors him and his methods because he feels that they bring results.
