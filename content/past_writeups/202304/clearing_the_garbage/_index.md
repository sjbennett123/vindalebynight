    oog: Tarps over boxes either inside or outside. This is a module that requires a bit more imagination on the part of the players to "imagine" a dump when we will have a hard to represent it.

Every 60 seconds, the marshal throws a packet into the air above the PCs as randomly as possible, calling Cause Weakness or Cause Disease.
