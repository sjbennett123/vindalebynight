synopsis: >

  The Tarrasch Chest filled with treasure props and an encounter card are placed in the woods early Friday night before game on away from the path and hidden from sight. The card and chest are placed in a way so they are able to be seen from the path. It is set away from where most people will go, but not so far away to keep people from wanting to carry the chest out. The card is a stand in for the dwarven guard guard Huldrek, who is on duty until Noon Saturday. The encounter card, attached to a tree at eye height, is a green envelope with the words READ ME printed in block letters. The card directs the PCs to return the card to the NPC shack and reads...
  
  > Congratulations! You have found a dwarf standing alone in the middle of the woods. Upon reading this card, you MUST return this card, with your group, to the NPC shack. You will return here to continue this encounter.
outcomes: Someone stumbles upon the encounter card and brings it and/or the chest, to the NPC shack, and then continues with the module OPERATION FIND HULDREK
