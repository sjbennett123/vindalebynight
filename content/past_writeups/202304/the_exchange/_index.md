running_notes: |
  The fight is ran as an ambush. The treasure drop off point allows the NPCs to get in close and attack from the rear and sides, pushing the PCs forward and together. At no point do the Tarrasch allow themselves to be cut off from retreat. When there are about four Tarrasch left, a retreat is be called and the rest flee and the King will kill Granny.
  
  Huldrek fights the Tarrasch when they appear.
  
  The Tarrasch fighting group should be filled in order of importance: the Tarrasch King, the Tarrasch Bishop, the Tarrasch Rook, the Tarrasch Knight, then the Tarrasch White Pawn, then Tarrasch Black Pawn Chaos Caster and Fighter.
  
  The Rook concentrates on keeping the Knight and King up, healing the pawns as needed.
  
  The Knight protects the King foremost, the Rook second, and attack third.
  
  The King coordinates the fight with the Bishop and run if needed back to Granny. Protect the Rook only if needed.
  
  The Rook can raise Undead [X number]
  
  The Bishop is to take orders from the King during the battle.
  
  The pawns listens for direction from the King and do as instructed. Any remaining Pawns flee when there are four (King, Bishop, Knight, Rook or any combo to make for total) Tarrasch members left standing. They retreat if the King goes down at anytime.
