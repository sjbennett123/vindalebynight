Layout: role

introduction: Huldrek is a simple dwarf, who loves his Granny. Unfortunately, Huldrek has fallen in with the wrong crowd. The Tarraschs came a'calling one day, and ol' Huldrek answered. Now, he's a Tarrasch pawn, who gets 2 gold a day as payment for his services. Huldrek is a egotistical and selfish dwarf who thinks of nothing but himself. He is crass and sarcastic, entitled, lazy, and a coward. Huldrek only thinks of Huldrek and how things effect him.
motivation: Huldrek is always thinking about where he can get his next drink and his next gambling fix. He is a coward and will run rather than fight. He loves his Grandmother, and will not hear anything bad about her.. He has no idea of the depth of depravity the Tarrasch are capable of. He has no idea that he is in a deadly group. He will deny any wrongdoing if questioned. He will claim he “just watches a box and runs errands for people”. He will never admit to betraying anyone, or even having knowledge that he betrayed anyone. He is a simple and gullible dwarf.

Abrasive-No one really likes Huldrek. He is gruff, angry, short tempered, and just all around an disagreeable dwarf. The complete opposite of Granny.
Addict- Huldrek has a big problem with gambling, and it has caused him to become a thug to fund his habit.
Alcoholic- Huldrek has a serious drinking problem he refuses to acknowledge. 
Charmless- Huldrek couldn't charm a wort on a toad, much less charm a person.
Conceited- He thinks he is the perfect specimen, despite having never won a fight.
Cowardly- If a real fight breaks out, Huldrek will always run. Being pressed even a little bit has him spouting family secrets.
Dependent- If it hadn't been for his grandmother, Huldrek would have lived and died in a gutter. He lacks the willpower to take care of himself.
Desperate- Huldrek has a severe gambling and drinking problem he has to finance. He has no job, despite his family name.
Dishonest- Huldrek will shake your hand with one hand and with the other, stab you in the back. You couldn't trust it if this man told you the sky was blue and the grass was green. 
Entitled- The world owes Huldrek everything.  
Greedy- Huldrek wants all the money, he just doesn't want to work for it.
Gullible- The Tarrasch was able to convince Huldrek to be their stooge, and to steal Granny's book.
Lazy- The only thing Huldrek has been on time for is his dinner. And don't give him anything to do with a deadline
Proud- Huldrek has a strong dwarven pride, even though he shouldn't be proud of the things he's done.
Stubborn- A dwarf with dwarven stubbornness
Thievish- Huldrek will, and has, robbed is own Grandmother blind. You think your purse is safe?
