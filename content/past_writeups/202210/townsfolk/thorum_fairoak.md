introduction: You are such a miserable and greedy Dwarf it cost you everything. Your inheritance was wasted on gambling and drinking. You were once a great jeweler of the days of old. No one could find a gem and care for it like Thorum Fairoak. One day you bet it all on a game of dice and lost everything. You never found out that the game was rigged from the start but out of fear of blackmail for your failing you were force into silence. Many years have passed by this time, but you don’t care about that life anymore. Only thing that suits you now is a pint of brew and starting at the ladies, maybe a roll of the dice here and there.

**Town Drunk**: Think of the most negative person you know and make them a Dwarf, that is Thorum Fairoak. This Dwarf cannot see the good in anything not involving Brews or Gambling. He used to be able to identify any gem or ore at a distance but that isn’t a skill he cares for now. Be very loud and obnoxious! You are the town drunk and you let people know your opinion on EVERYTHING 

**Loves the Occupation**: Make sure you talk about how you think the best thing that has happened to Stonewood is the occupation! It makes shady people like you not so bad in the grand scheme. If the PCs try to talk you into rebellion call them crazy and tell them the Bloody Fist will slaughter, you all. Drive home the point that they will start executing people by the dozens if the treaty is broken again. Tell everyone you will just leave town and doom will set in on them if they fight the Bloody Fist.

- If pressed on this topic: explain that it doesn’t matter who “owns” or “runs” the town cause they all are corrupt at the core and selfish.


- You are about the ONLY person in Stonewood who still fully trusts Mayor Anak Durag. He used to be your best friend when you ran “Thorums Emporium” 10 years ago but that is all down the drain. 
  - Anak has your back when people try to toss you out or silence you but you know he is a coward with a big title so you will sing his praises to everyone.
  - To be fair Anak has worked out a “livable” treaty with the Bloody Fist where they don’t kill you, they supply you with basic food and drink, and will protect you from outside threats if you simply follow the Accord of the Fist.
