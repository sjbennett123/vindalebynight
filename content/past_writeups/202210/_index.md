The Bloody Fist suffered a set back but not a defeat. Sure they had lost a battle here or there, had the city buildings reclaimed, but they instilled fear into the hearts of the adventurers. The force the Bloody Fist had left behind was not prepared to deal with so many skilled adventurers at once. They pulled back what small expeditionary forces they left behind for the Winter, they will continue to scout and let the people of Stonewood think they have won for now, but come winters break they will return with a General and his army. Proper Bloody Fist troops, equipped to the teeth for war not occupation! The wrath of the Bloody Fist shall be swift and merciless. They will issue a message to the town of Stonewood before years end giving them one final chance to “lay down their arms and put forth the main perpetrators who started the rebellion, especially the “Elf who wears our fallen Warlords banner on his waist, Hennet” (Clinton)
