description: The Bloody Fist have taken over the Alchemy Lab in Stonewood! This is horrible for the town as the production of potions will stop without it being restored. The Bloody Fist with full control over a towns supply of Alchemy will make them very scary.
Running_Notes: The Alchemy Lab of Stonewood is a crucial part of its defense against the hordes of night creatures. This module is a LITERAL bullet hell! When they are engaged and the Revenants rise from the ground, Orange packets will fly in mass! The NPCS are waiting on them for this one in ambush style. Grunts and Undead Alchemist reset 3 times each. The Shamans will reset ONCE. Grunts should form a wall to take PC packets and protect the NPC casters. Shaman should focus on healing and disabling PCs with status effects. Celestial shaman should blow the players up with blasts. The NPCs may appear behind the players and start from outside the mod shack where they players entered to simulate being surrounded. This module is designed for more seasoned adventurers or mid-range adventurers with veterans tagging along.

Synopsis: The Bloody Fist have control of the Stonewood Alchemy lab and trouble is literally brewing. The Shamans have resurrected the 5 top Guild Alchemists as Undead Revenants. They died protecting the secrets so now they will serve in undeath more loyally.
Outcomes: 
 - The Bloody Fist are defeated and cleared from the Alchemy Lab, the Bloody Fist are not resupplied with new Alchemy potions and gases 
 - The Bloody Fist take as much Alchemy and Gases as they can carry! The remainder of the weekend, random Blood Fist will be able to throw Gas Globes and drink potions to boost their stat cards. This is detailed in the section â€œOrcish Alchemy"
Rumors: > 
  The Alchemists of Stonewood have been under duress with gathering and production for a month now. This has the people on edge as Winter rapidly approaches. They complain about their supplies going missing or being assaulted for their herbal pickings in the woods. I hope this is from brigands, but they seem to be something not human from the scars they return with.
