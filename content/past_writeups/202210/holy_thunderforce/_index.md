description: The Bloody Fist have taken the Scholars Guild. Bodies lie among the halls of the Scholars guild from a fierce battle but in the end the Bloody Fist were too much.
Requirements: 
 - Saturday Afternoon
 - Strange Alchemy module has been run
Synopsis: The Bloody Fist have control of the Stonewood Scholars Guild. This was the biggest setback in terms of casaulties the Bloody Fist suffered thus far. Most of the troops in here now are casters and the undead scholars who fell during the fighting. The Bloody Fist is desperate, they have created a horde of undead since only their Shamans remain.
Outcomes: 
 - The Bloody Fist are defeated and cleared from the Scholars Guild. Stopping them allows the remaining Scholars to return and care for the dead
 - The Bloody Fist butcher any survivors and take all the formal magic scrolls/tomes/books/magic items they can find back to camp to redistribute.
Rumors: > 
  The Scholars Guild of Stonewood has seemed to be doing the best they have in months; surprising considering our situation here. They are working under the table to heal wounded soldiers and travelers. The celestial scholars have been offering protectives for the citizens if they have been attacked lately. They must be close to kicking the keg. I don’t know how they are doing so well with so few.

Running_Notes: The Scholars Guild is a mess of a fight, there are no grunts to protect the scholars so it’s a big spell bash. The Undead Scholars pick either Earth or Celestial (divide evenly) and just go to town, protecting themselves by any means. Use AS MANY Create Undead if PC die. Undead Scholars reset 1 time in first room and 2 times in second room. The Shamans will reset ONCE in second room. Second room uses the “loop around” mechanic. Shaman should focus on healing and disabling PCs with status effects. Celestial shaman should blow the players up with blasts. Remember Shamans can Rift on 3 count. Keep the Undead up at all costs because they are your only protection since the Scholars guild killed the Grunts. The NPCs may appear behind the players and start from outside the mod shack where they players entered to simulate being surrounded. This module is designed for more seasoned adventurers.
