- Forged by Broken Hands module has been run

 - ~1 Hour after this module has been completed, the Cutters guild will bring into town a new Stonewood sign to replace the destroyed one at the towns entrance as a symbol of hope to the people~
Rumors: > 
  I have heard talk of a new weapon they are trying to create to make this war even easier for them. Something about “Only Stonewood Lumber can build the strength of projectile we need” I haven’t seen any prototypes yet the weapon itself. But it does not sound good for any of us if they build it
