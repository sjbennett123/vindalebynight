Magnus spent weeks studying the Altar and discovered how to defeat it through extensive trial and error. He even pulled out prototype Celestial Golems to battle the changed ones,that is how he got enough destroyed at once to push the Altar to cracking the first time, but he nearly died discovering this and his Golems were destroyed. Magnus stays in town to make sure they understand how to defeat the changed ones before he returns to the Rygal Order forward camp.

Magnus is a Archwizard of Celestial Magic, his like has not been seen in recent memory without being absolutely insane. The most outgoing and friendly member of the Rygal Order. He is often sent as the face of the Order to make good relations. An adventurer before joining the Order, his will to help adventurers is admirable.
