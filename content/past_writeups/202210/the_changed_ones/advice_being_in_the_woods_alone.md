title: "(Advice) Being in the Woods Alone"

---

Playing a role that requires that you be in the woods for an extended period is a challenge. It might not be fun for you due to the boredom or the lack of social engagement. Decide if you are ok with this kind of experience before you sign on.

It helps to have a vague idea of how long you are going to be out there, but you should always expect to be out there far longer than you plan. You will be out there for a while and unable to be reached. If something is going in your personal life you might not be able to take to be reached this could lead to you declining to take the role. Make sure that you are not committed to another role later that day or are the only person that can do some vital process such as check in or first aid. 

## Preparation

Stretch and wear appropriate shoes. Use the bathroom and eat before you head out. Bring snacks and water so that you don’t get stuck. If possible, stash water in the woods. If you stash water in the woods be sure to pick it up when you are done.

## Terrain

Be careful of terrain and wildlife. Don’t let yourself roll your ankle or get bit by a snake. Treat your clothes with insect repellent and check for ticks at the end of the encounter. Don’t lure the players into situations that are too dangerous.

## Tactics

As you are walking around take stock of where a defensible place is and plan an exit. Hide by keeping still and listening then moving when there is other noise so that your noise is masked. If you are about to be found out, decide if you are going to run or stay and fight.

Engage in battle on your terms, choosing where and how you fight. You are going to be outnumbered if you are rash don't overcommit and get mobbed. Be as fast as possible, when fighting avoid letting the battle drag on.
