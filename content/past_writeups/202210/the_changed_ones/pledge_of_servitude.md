Every day at 10PM the town of Stonewood gathers to pledge allegiance to the bloody fist and to offer up their tithe.  
The Accords of the Fist mandate that the town give an offering every day. This is led by the mayor but if he is away of in infirm health another member of the citizenry will perform this ceremony. Each of the townspeople that are able will join around a banner of the bloody fist and recite the Pledge of Servitude. 

> The mighty bloody fist is benevolent.
>
> The mighty bloody fist is kind.
>
> The mighty bloody fist is gentle.
>
> We accept our place below the mighty orc. *{bow}*
>
> We offer now our meager tribute though we know it will never be enough.
>
> The great orc horde watches over us.
>
> The great orc horde protects us.
