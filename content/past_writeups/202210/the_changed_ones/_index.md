background: The Ritual of the Changed Ones requires the sacrifices of 6 souls who are willing to submit themselves for a promise of power. They are bound to an altar and changed forever. The altar roars in terrible black flame and consumes the soul, warping it into a horrific monster consumed by their most base inner desires but their will is bound to those who enacted the ritual. The Altar can be destroyed by overloading it with 3 or more spirits of the Changed Ones at once.
synopsis: > 
  The players are met at the road by the NPC Dwarves of Stonewood who explain that while they are living under the rule of the Bloody Fist, there is peace. They plead for the characters to follow the Accords of the Fist. These accords are enforced by supernatural creatures called The Changed Ones. The Changed Ones will not harm you if you follow the Accords of the Fist, but the second they are assaulted or break the accords, they will hunt you down without mercy. They incapacitate their target and let the Bloody Fist collect them. The monsters revive/renew at the Altar after 5 minutes so are effectively invincible. While they are completing the module, the townsfolk try to convince the players to lay down arms and not get them all killed telling the players about the last group of adventurers who came through and tried to defeat the Bloody Fist but were ultimately slaughtered. 
  Magnus Kane of the Rygal Order approaches the adventurers and explains that he has discovered a weakness of the Changed Ones. The Altar can be destroyed by having 3 or more of the Changed Ones reforming at the same time. If the Altar is overloaded, the Hoyleans wonâ€™t be able to respawn anymore so there will only be 3 remaining monsters to kill. 
outcomes:
  - The players enter Stonewood and figure out the mystery of the Altar, defeat 3 or more Changed Ones at once, thus overloading the Altar and ending the ritual.
  - The players hide from the monsters until the morning in their Wards and cabins to meet the Bloody Fist with the monsters alive still.
  - The players attempt to make a deal with the Bloody Fist, but it will ultimately fail since the Bloody Fist have zero clue who the adventurers are.

rumors: >
  These terrible monsters are powered by some sorcery I am unfamiliar with. I have not seen this magic on Tyrra in my lifecycle, but I am familiar with its origins. Do not engage them alone! There are 6 powerful ones and then lesser ones. I have killed as many as I physically and spiritually can, but we need outside help. The Order is mobilizing to fight but we need more time. Rise up and we will join you. You are not alone Stonewood.
