The Accords of the Fist were agreed to by the townspeople as part of the parlay with the brutal Bloody Fist Orcs. There was some initial resistance but now itâ€™s just how you live your life. When you see anyone that is not following the rules you will be concerned that the Orcs will see that the agreement is not being kept to. You have been safe after the initial purge but, those that did not obey the laws that the Bloody Fist put down have not been so lucky. 

- No weapons on person or drawn
- No spells in hand
- No verbal condemnation of Orcish Might
- Kneel or bow at the Bloody Fist Banners
- Attend the pledge of freedom and tithe nightly
