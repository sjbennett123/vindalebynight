description: The Bloody Fist have taken the main brewery of Stonewood! Without it the townsfolk won’t be able to suffer the occupation without strong brews and spirits. A Raid Leader took a group of Bloody Fist into the Brewery to drink it dry!
author: Chris Colland 
reviewer: Scott Bennett
Requirements: 
 - Saturday Afternoon
 - The Lumber Job module has been run
Synopsis: The Bloody Fist have come to the brewery and are drinking it dry! This band of Uruk’s are smashing everything and getting drunk, starting fights with each other. 
Outcomes: 
 - The Brewery is cleared out and the ale is saved! These Bloody Fist have an extremely high alcohol tolerance and will get the whole camp drunk on Dwarven Ale if they are able. If the PCs save the Brewery, Balor Ironleaf will promise them a beer to be named after the act of heroism 
 - The Brewery is drank dry! No more freely flowing spirit for the weekend in Stonewood! The people will drop in mood and morale if they hear the Brewery was emptied. This was their last way to feel hope in town. This is detailed in the section “No More Ale” 
 - ~The players will get the chance to name a beer in the game after their deeds. Balor Ironleaf will ask them to pick a name after the module if they succeed~
Rumors: > 
  These scaled fools are drinking the Brewery down, even by Dwarven standards! I don’t know how they can walk after these indulgences, I am in envy personally. However, if something isn’t done soon, we will be into winter without spirits and that is a fate worse than death in a Dwarven city.

**This is the midway point in the 10 module series where it starts to become challenging.** 


Tactics: The Raid Leader should stay back and command the Grunts and Scouts mainly but use gases if directly rushed. They are master of tactics and organization of thes brutes The NPCs will rest 2 times upon death and come from other parts of the Brewery to defend. THE RAID LEADER DOES NOT RESET. The NPCs may appear behind the players and start from outside the mod shack where they players entered to simulate being surrounded. This module is designed for mid seasoned adventurers
