title: No More Ale
---

As a dwarf you are used to free-flowing ale. The failure of these heroes to recuse the brewery is a defeat that you would have not expected. They seemed so capable, but they forget the most important thing of all. 

If the module is failed the tavern no longer has ale on tap. All the Dwarves get the following traits.

**Constantly Complain**: Every time some inconvenience happens make sure to mention that this would be a lot easier to manage if there was just some ale to wash it away.

**Degrade the skills of the adventurers**: When the adventurers are going on an adventure be sure to bring up that they couldnâ€™t even save the ale.
