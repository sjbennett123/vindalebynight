description: Captured adventurers have been taken to a Bloody Fist Black Site with a cruel taskmaster, Jiren “Bonesaw” the Jailor for torture and possible sacrifice depending on the jailor’s mood.
Outcomes: 
 - PCs come rescue the captured and defeat Bonesaw or flee from him.   
 - If PCs fail to find the encampment and an hour passes, one captured will be sacrificed, Forget-It-Well’d, and sent to the circle. A surviving captured PC or NPC will be Spirit Marked with the blood of the sacrificed in the warpaint style of the Bloody Fist (3 Red Marks down the right side of face)
Requirements: 
  - ANYTIME the PCs are dropped and captured by the Bloody Fist
Synopsis: The PCs have the option to come rescue their captured friends for 1hr after the capture. The camp will be set up at different locations depending on how this module is ran. The first encounter with Bonesaw will be outside. Repeat visits to this campsite can be ran in the Mod Shack or outside depending on weather. 
Hook: Captured PCs or Named NPCS the players wish to rescue
Props: 
 - Anything to represent a Orc prison camp, 
 - spikes
 - chains
 - fire
 - rope
 - severed heads
 - executioners block
 - large axe
treasure: 
 - PC or NPC saved
running_notes: This module is a module on pause until triggered by a capture. Bonesaw is an especially cruel jailor and will demand blood sacrifices made to send a message. Set the camp up so there is only one real approach to getting in. If outside, tie the captured up with a rope/chain prop to something. The rope/chain can be undone with a key on Bonesaw’s body. The players can kill Bonesaw or drop him and search him for the key. If he is killed he is dead, the remainder rescue mods won’t have Bonesaw but will be filled in with more Bloody Fist Grunts/Shaman. The Shamans should focus on keeping Bonesaw alive to keep the players in a stat of panic and disorder.  If more than 5 rescues are used the next will have a Raid Leader and 3 Honor Guard as a high threat trap to get more when they come. This will be a capture trap module, but the Honor Guards will be KBA as per their normal card and MO.
