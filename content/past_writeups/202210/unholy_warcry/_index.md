description: The Bloody Fist have taken Mausoleum of Fallen Heroes in Stonewood. They have left a mess of Undead abominations behind to fight as a final insult to the Stonewood citizens.
author: Chris Colland
Reviewer: Scott Bennett
Running_Notes:  The Mausoleum is the final module in the Reclaiming Stonewood Arc. This module will be very challenging for the players. The Vampire Lord must be killed with a Stake of Woe or he will take his death count and respawn at Night. The status effects will be brutal on this module. The Death Knights will be Killing Blow Active should they have a chance to raise more Undead. The Vampire Lord will try to Arcane Vampire Charm PCs so kill their friends. The Abominations are shock troops, they will rush and try to kill who they can. The Death Knights Will rest 2 times and the Undead Abominations will reset 4 times. This module is designed for seasoned adventurers or the town to help. 
Requirements: 
 - Saturday Afternoon
 - Holy Thunderforce module has been run
Synopsis: The Bloody Fist have raised all forms of Undead Abominations for the PCs to deal. Balor Ironleaf comes stumbling into ground beat up and with Tainted Blood from trying to stop them himself. The Bloody Fist have completely abandoned the Mausoleum, Balor’s magic will only hold them in for a short while so the PCs must act quickly to hit them before they overflow to the city
Outcomes: 
- The Undead Abominations are defeated, and the corpses are returned to rest in their tombs. No citizens are harmed 
- The Undead Abominations overflow from the Mausoleum and start infecting the Townsfolk who remain. The Townsfolk will start changing into Undead at Sunset and attack the town till they are killed. This is detailed in the section “A Terrible Night to Have a Curse”
Rumors: > 
  The Mausoleum of Fallen Heroes in Stonewood has seen too many visitors for my liking as of late. They appear to be Dwarves but some larger cloaked figures are among them. I could just be paranoid but something in my years or service to Stonewood tells me something is afoot. Stones help us if it is what I think is happening comes true.
