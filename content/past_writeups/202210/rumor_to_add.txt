For almost 3 years I have wandered the outskirts of the crystal barrier in the mists... studying... observing. Three years isn't so long for some of the races but for a human... the fog has felt like an eternity. The silence has been deafening, my mind questioning what I have felt and seen. Parts of me have fractured, drifting and traveling to new worlds... they have felt like dreams yet I know they are still me... am I going mad? I have not heard from my family in years, i have not felt the connection to my Queen in years. The trees had grown silent. I tried to go home but I could not find my way there. Is this madness???
And now! The trees have awakened once again, the mysts have begun to lift, I can see clearer now. I saw the call to arms to invade the crystal barrier... But yet I question the sanity of it all... is this some trick, some game by the powers of the cosmos? So many questions... so many answers needed. Am I alone in this? Is this just another sign of my own madness??? So many questions...
I am not even sure why I am writing on the trees, maybe I'm just talking to myself, maybe it's my last grasp at what remains of my sanity... so many questions...
