If left unchecked this will give Bloody Fist access to Dwarves craft. The Scouts will be looking through the Forge for secrets of Dwarven metallurgy while the 2 Bloody Fist Grunts are attempting to forge something to take back.

Rumors: > 
  It seems to me that these creatures have taken an interest in Dwarven smiting. I can’t tell if they are looking for Ore or weaponry. But it appears the creatures want to find something in the forge that the Dwarves have been hiding.
