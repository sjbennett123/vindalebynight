description: "A Will-O-Wisp is floating around town gathering people’s attention to take them on a journey they will not soon forget…"
synopsis:   >
  A seemingly rogue Will-O-Wisp is wandering around town after players start settling in for the night after dealing with The Changed Ones. This Will-O-Wisp has an agenda unlike most Will-O-Wisps floating around the lands at night. The Will-O-Wisp has a magical tree it calls home with its fellow Wisps, but Hessol Korag the Vampire has threatened to destroy this tree with a Cold Iron Axe if the Wisps do not do its bidding. 
  
  The Will-O-Wisps wander around the outskirts and into town trying to gather as many people as possible to lure to Hessol Korag’s blood feast. The self-proclaimed Vampire Prince Hessol has been working on replenishing his feeding stock and with a huge disruption in town with fresh blood he plans to do just that!  

  Once the Will-O-Wisps have lured enough people away by their presence or by Arcane Charming them and commanding them to “Follow Me” the Wisps will return to Hessol with his newly converted Ghouls to feast upon them after a fresh bite. Hessol and the 5 Ghouls are waiting in an ambush near unused cabins down the other side of town for the new arrivals to the blood feast.
