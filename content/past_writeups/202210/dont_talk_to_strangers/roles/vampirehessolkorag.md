introduction: > 
  You were once a peaceful livestock farmer of Woodhaven near Vindale. The Vampire courts in Vindale demanded “your livestock or your life” and you fled in the middle of the night. Vampiric forces caught up to you that night and slaughtered your livestock and left you with a terrible mark, a bite on your neck.

  You woke up in a dark cave with a letter explaining your new existence as a Vampire. You fled north in anger and attempted to setup a cult of new “livestock” as your previous Vindale oppressors did, but you began to enjoy the power rush and pleasure you got from stalking the people in Woodhaven. You tried Orc blood and threw it up in disgust, with all the Bloody Fist around it has made your cult making hard but you are going to give it a shot.

**Impostor**: Hessol is a self-proclaimed “Prince” of The Stonewood Circle of Blood. This is a total lie and meant to spread fear among the town. 

**Braggard**: You are very proud and arrogant about your “accomplishments”.

**Vindale is Occupied**: Mention to the players that Vindale may still be under Vampire control, but the court fell 3 years ago.
