**Storyteller**: Balor is a gruff old grumpy Dwarf but a very honorable one. He has seen more battles with the monsters of Elysia than he cares to remember. You can always get him to talk about his glory days over a nice warm pint. No one knows the town of Stonewood better than Balor, he keeps tabs on everyone for the greater good of the town. Depending how the PCs interact with him, he will start to open up about rebellion or laugh at their dreams of liberating the town of Stonewood.

**Patriot**: He is very protective of Stonewood, this occupation is a literal living hell for him. He wants to liberate the town badly, but his spirits have been crushed this last year.

**Broken**: He won’t carry any weapons actively so he can respect the Accords of the Fist but he keeps spells hidden on himself to aid the Citizens when the Bloody Fist are brutal to them.

**Back in Action**: If the town is restored after the first event Balor’s satisfaction, he will reinstate the Black Anvil Company as the new Town Guard for Stonewood with he PCs support.
