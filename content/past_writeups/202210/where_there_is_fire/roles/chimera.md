introduction: The Chimera is a magical creature that roams the landed regions of Tyrra in search of food. It has a nearly insatiable appetite, and will eat virtually anything. It reproduces asexually by laying a single egg once every three years. The egg hatches in a day, and the Chimera grows to full size within a few hours. These creatures are nomadic and extremely solitary. If two Chimeras encounter one another in the wild they will fight to the death.
