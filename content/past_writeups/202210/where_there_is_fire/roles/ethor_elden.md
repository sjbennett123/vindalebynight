introduction: A capricious wizard who is not fucking around. He was taken for a ride by the Brothers for a cloak. He originally agreed on paying 10 gold for the best quality of wool. When he went to pick up the Cloak, the Brothers wanted to charge him 15 Gold due to cost overruns, and changes to the specifications by Ethor. The cloak was supposed to be of the best quality of wool but is starting to wear earlier than he expected. He put a Chimera Egg he got from a fey he knows.
