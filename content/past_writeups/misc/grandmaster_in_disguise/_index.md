running_notes: At no time should the Grandmaster ever, ever, ever reveal his actual persona. The Grand Master's cruel ways should never be reviled. Even the name “The Grand Master” is forbidden. The Grand Master should be super easy to like. A guy you would want to hang out with. A good ol' boy. He should gamble, and be a good sport. Throw a hand or two if necessary to keep people happy. The prices set for goods are kingdom standard +3. In negotiation, you shouldn't go less than 3 of whatever value. For example, you are selling a potion. Kingdom standard is 5 gold. You have them listed for 8 gold, and will negotiate down to 5 gold. Going lower than kingdom is discouraged
