description: A treasure hunter has found a crypt of an old Dwarven noble and wishes to bring a group of adventurers with him in case there are any dangers that need cleared. They don't know the crypt holds a secret in it's lowest depths!
Synopsis: With the orcs being pushed back, explorer's have struck out once more from the town. A crypt was found and luckily it was undisturbed. The treasure hunter that found it wishes to bring a group of adventurers with him so he can ransack the treasures within!
Outcomes:
 - The players escape the crypt due to overwhelming odds of the undead and traps that are within. 
 - The players are all killed because of traps and the undead. 
 - They find the treasure within the treasure room, where there is a Djinn waiting to fulfill his end of the bargain, which is to give away 2 more wishes so he can go back to his own plain of existence (There are multiple outcomes for this, see card for details)
Rumors: Ever since the orcs have been pushed back and the guilds started to return, some of the scouts and other explorers have struck out. Buildings that have thought to have been ransacked by the orcs are being rediscovered once more.
Hook:  Dorag Barkborer wishes to gather a small group of adventurers to help explorer one of his families crypts.
Running notes: Dorag is to die immediately upon entering the crypt from the skeletons. There is no card for him. If he is attacked or waylaid at town, presume he only has 10 body and swings 5 normal with whatever weapon he has. The Skeletons do no reset. There are to be four for when they attack at each scene. The Djinn does not move away from it's “bottle” or whatever is used to house it and does not attack unless provoked or attacked itself. This should be for newer players or those who are lvl 20 or under. Try to bring a rogue and emphasize traps so new rogue players can use their skills.
Treasure: 
 - Coins(few hundred if possible) 
 - Formal Components 
 - Magic Items +0 Magic Polearm or Indestructible Magic Armor or Shield (depends on outcome, see card for details) Gem that can bring forth Djinn when called for (again, depends on outcome see card for details)
Non-Standard Effects: The skeletons will yell out **STONE BONES** and will become impervious to five attacks. They can only do this once. The Djinn also grants wishes, but they are not so easily fulfilled. The Djinn card will have all of it's effects.
Props: 
 - Tarps for narrow hallways
 - spear boffers for wall spikes
 - Tape for marking where traps are (possible trip wires if there are any in shack)
