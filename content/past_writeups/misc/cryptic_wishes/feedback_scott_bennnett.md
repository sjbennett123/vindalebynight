In the brief it's a treasure hunter but in the synopsis it's a family crypt which one is it. 

How are you planning to kill time while we get the different levels set up. it feels like a bit of time will be needed. 

What costuming does the Genie wear? 

Give that dwarf that goes into town a real card. Don't make him go into the crypt and get killed. I don't see that happening easily. Make him just not go in. 

I feel like the cards for genie wishes are a little thin. I'd like more meat on the bone there.
