The Djinn is an ancient Air Elemental that has been trapped within a vessel by a powerful wizard from a distant land. It was gifted to Bolag Barkborer a hundred years ago by a shady merchant for a cheap price. Being ripped away from your home plane into a tiny place has worn on you for the past thousand years. When you where finally summoned by the silly Dwarf, he made the bargain of three wishes and you could be free. But now that he is dead and you are stuck in the crypt, you will gran the final two to someone lucky enough to stumble upon you.

 There are many moving parts to go with this monster/card. First is the wishes. The players can say whatever they want, and they will hope to get what comes to mind, but they seem to forget that it's not as cut and dry as they would hope so. For whatever they “wish for” they will get it in some fashion, these are the guidelines.

## If players wish for

**Money (any amount):** A Gold Golem appears and attacks the players, it drops at least 100 gold coins (more if possible)

**Magic Items:** If they wish a magic weapons, a polearm will appear and attack the players. If Magic Armor or shield, a suit of living armor will attack the players. These will drop a +0 weapon or just a piece of armor or shield that has a magic aura on it and is indestructible for 1year. If they wish for formal components, they will be attacked by a living spell.

**If they wish to leave:** If someone says they wish to leave, the Djinn rifts them to a random plane. There is a chance they will die and return to the Earth Circle due to the environment of said plane of existence, but a friendly elemental will drop their stuff off at the circle.  Roll a d8 to determine where they go

1. Fire
2. Earth
3. Water
4. Wind
5. Chaos
6. Order
7. Death
8. Life

**They wish to be Happy/Loved/ anything related to these:** They get sent straight to the plane of Life

**They wish for anything Macrabe/Cringey/way to sexual:** They get sent straight to the plane of Death

**If they wish for the Djinn to be free as the first wish:** The Djinn wants to go home, but they won't tell the players that doing the two wishes releases the bonds. Wishing the Djinn free on the first wish will make them very happy and they will reward the players with a gem that will call the Djinn to them to aid them in anyway once ever. They will **NOT** receive this gem if they wish the Djinn free on their second wish or if they use both wishes for other things.
