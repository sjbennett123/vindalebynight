- I like the idea of traps being utilized by the dwarves protecting their loot.
- I like the idea of hanging tarps better for us to create different spaces. Perhaps using chairs tables, and ladders with the tarps will accomplish this effect?

-  I think it would be better to stat the Module hook and give it more back story or roleplaying tips. Just in case something goes down. The NPC can interact with a world around it. Suppose he gets jumped by a wandering monster? 

- Perhaps the motivation can be different? Maybe Dorag the dwarf is just checking on his Family’s crypt to make sure it was not defiled by the Orcs. Maybe he knows what is in there, maybe not.

- The Djinn: Wishes are very powerful non-standard effects, and players will spend a lot of time and tie up resources to figure out the “perfect wish”. Can we put anything else in place of this?

  - Can we make it like the holy grail in Indiana Jones and if it is removed from the crypt, it shatters or dissipates? 

- Non-Standard effect “Stone Bones”: I don’t think anyone will know how to play this call properly. Can we utilize standard effects, like additional body, or a different monster to produce the same effect / level of danger?

- For the monsters, it is hard to take “half damage” from some people, and full damage from others, when you have multiple attackers. Can we add body and do less complicated math for the NPC’s?

- If the target audience is under level twenty the module hook needs to say things to the big guys like: 

  - “I cannot pay for powerful adventures”

  - “I don’t think there is a lot of danger”

  - “I am sure this is not worth your time”

  - “ if these guys run into trouble they will send word.”
