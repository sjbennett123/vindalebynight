title: Bomb Charge Ritual Camp 1

![/modules/orcamedies_special_1.png](/modules/orcamedies_special_1.png "{width='50%'}" )

 - This ritual is a very crude design and requires a sacrifice in blood to complete it.

 - The Ritual is setup connected to a Stonewood Tree with a large Circle laid out on the ground and then 2 smaller circle outlines where the Shaman and the Sacrifice must stand when charging the bomb ritual. The other marks on the mark are generally where Bloody Fist Guards stand.

 - The Shaman begins the ritual by cutting his own hand to spill blood onto the roots of the tree. The Shaman will remain silent and gesture attempting to align the energies of the Stonewood Trees with the energy of the Bloody Fist to imbue the bomb shard. 

 - As long as the bomb shard is being held by someone at the end of the ritual, the shard will be charge via the ritual. Normally, this ritual is attuned to Orcs only and nothing would happen other than the holder of the Shard being blasted with Arcane damage as the shard is overloaded and charged. However, if a non-Bloody Fist is holding the shard at the rituals end, the Arcane blast still hits the wielder of the shard BUT ALL CASTER OF THE RITUAL DIE!

 - If any of the caster of the rituals are hit during the fight that will ensue at the site, a Hold will be called and EVERYONE inside the circle will take **100 Points of Arcane Damage via Formal Backlash akin to a Vengeance.**

 - Bloody Fist holding the shard can freely pick up and put down the bomb shard and join the fight then re-enter their circle to resume holding the focus for the ritual’s completion. If anyone non-Bloody Fist attempts to leave the circle with a bomb shard before it is charged, they will be struck with **100 Points of Arcane Damage** and the bomb shard will drop just inside the ritual circle physical rep on the ground.

 - The way this module is defeated is with a very tactical and careful battle, the Bloody Fist will stay in the larger circle and force the adventurers to come into the circle. But they know if they hit the Shaman then everyone in the circle will die. They will attempt to lure them into accidently hitting them. The PCs should position themselves and use takedown spells to lock the Bloody Fist in place to stop them from making this harder OR just rush in and stab them very quickly while avoiding the Shaman casting the Ritual. 

 - If these 10 Charged Bomb Shards are assembled on The Orcamedes Special bomb the effects will be reduced by how many shards they obtained (See module “The Fury of Our Makers Hand” for details), if the Bloody Fist obtain all 10 charged and place them around Stonewood in a tactical formation, these bomb shards act as amplifiers and will dramatically extend the range of the bombs attack on the psyche

 - If the PCs fail to charge a Bomb Shard, they may take the uncharged ones to another bombsite and attempt to charge them during other rituals but there is a 50% chance they will charge or 50% chance they will detonate another blast of 70 Points of Arcane Body Damage and the magic on

 - The charged status of the bomb shards ONLY effect the potency of the bomb, if they still obtain all 10 just fail to charge them, the Magic Item Bomb Shard will still be delivered to town after the module “The Fury of Our Makers Hand”
