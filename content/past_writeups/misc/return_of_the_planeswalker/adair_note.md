title: "Adair's Note"

Adventurers,

I am looking for a small group of you to come into the Stonewood and meet with me. I cannot reveal myself to the forces that are currently occupying your area, more for your safety than my own. I have sent my loyal hound to deliver this note and to show you. Any adventurer who has not seen many seasons should come meet me. I eagerly await.

~A
