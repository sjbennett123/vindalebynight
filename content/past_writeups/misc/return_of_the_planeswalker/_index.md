description: Adair has returned. He seeks his missing partner and thinks the orcs attacking Stonewood are corrupted by Void magic.
Background: With orcs attacking the town of Stonewood with new magics and tactics, Adair believes something more sinister is creeping upon the lands he was watched over. His partner went to investigate a few years ago but never came back. Adair now must wade into a war that is not his to find out what is going on.
Synopsis: A white wolf will approach the Tavern with a note. This note directs a small group of adventurers to meet with “A Druid” deep within the woods of Stonewood. People who have met Adair in the past and remember this exact process can go. Upon meet Adair, they will meet a man that has several arcane marks upon him. He lets them know who he is and what he is doing there. He is looking for his Planes-walker partner and believes the Orcs are corrupted by the Void and wishes to enlist the adventurers in gathering information.

Running_Notes: Campfire Use a campfire for this module if the weather is not terrible. We will not do the fire if there is a downpour, but will do it if it is drizzling or just wet after a rain. There is to be no fighting at all near the fire! We will need someone to watch over the fire while it is lit, and there should be a bucket or a container filled with water ready to douse it when the module is over.
Requirements: 
  - Should be run after Lord of the Woods. Adair will have similar colors as the lights and to confuse some players, but it's just a genuine mistake.
