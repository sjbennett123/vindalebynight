description: Adventurers fight off 

Synopsis: Val’Kaz really turned up the sinister game with this move. He wanted to hit Stonewood where It hurts, their pride. Orcamedes was ordered to construct him a vile insect that would burrow into the roots of the Stonewood Trees and poison them to wither them away to watch the morale on shatter on in their eyes. The Gnawing Ones they were named, they are very effective in worker society and combat. Modeled after a termite for its wood destroying properties but genetically modified with varies other bug species to make them vicious and venomous….

outcomes:
  - The PCs will enter the Cave to engage the Gnawing Ones and defeat them to stop their destruction of the Stonewood Trees from the roots. Once they are all dead they set off a Fumigation Device to prevent that Tree from being infected further and allow it to heal. 
  - The PCs fail to stop the Gnawing Ones and they continue to gnaw away and the Stonewood Roots to destroy them with enough time

Rumors: |
  “I have received a rather… Disturbing report from the Rangers Guild of Stonewood. There has been an odd disappearance as of late regarding various bugs in or around Stonewood. Not sure what this means for us, but it seems to be linked to something odd… According to Guildmaster Fuli Oakrider, the bugs most prominently missing are ones that can burrow and ones that feed on wood…”

Hook: Know Your Enemy provided them with a map and information on the Gnawing Ones, but Magnus Kane brought them a Fumigation Device and gave them a detailed rundown how to defeat these creatures. Now it is upto the Adventurers to clear them

Running_Notes: |
  This is 1 of 10 modules, they will scale with increasing difficulty in terms of what they will fight but more importantly HOW they will fight. Each Cave will have a Bloody Fist Banner at the entrance of the Cave, aka just inside the Mod shack door. The Banners are VERY important to these modules, the Gnawing Ones are afraid of the Banners. They will not advance past them or at you if you brandish a Bloody Fist Banner. The players may move the wooden base with the Bloody Fist Banner through the Cave to “control” the way the Gnawing Ones engage the Players. The Gnawing Ones will not leave the Caves to pursue the players under any circumstances. The Gnawing Ones have a special way they kill you, they wont drop you and begin a killing blow count like most monsters or players will. They want you to be paralyzed and helpless so they can look you in the eyes when they push their claws into your heart and feel the fear gush out onto them as you bleed out on their chitinous exoskeletons.

  The Device given to them by Magnus Kane will be a one time use “Death Gas” on the Gnawing Ones if they set it off in a Cave on Saturday. If anyone remains in the Cave after the Fumigation Device is set off after 1 minute they will be struck with a “Death” effect should they stay in the Caves. This device would be detonated and they should leave the Banners infront of the Doors to trap the Gnawing Ones in the Caves while the Fumigation kills them. The gas will remain for 1 hour after it is set off so the players need to loot before they set off this device or they have 60 seconds to loot and run!

It's never been much of my concern, I've grown in size again, still fine? 

*Just when you thought the Bloody Fist couldn’t sink any lower. Val’Kaz the Ruthless ordered a creature to destroy the very thing that makes Stonewood so unique, the  Stonewood Trees!*



**Unspoiled Cave 1 Notes:** This Cave is the first in the series, the Bloody Rats are skulking around the caves and almost hiding from the Gnawing Ones just looking for some Orc Bloody to feed one. The Gnawing Ones will stop creeping around to stalk their prey when they hear players and they two creatures will come to an understanding that these are both enemies of the Bloody Fist.

**VAL’KAZ CAN APPEAR ON ANY ONE OF THESE MODULES!!! A DICE ROLL WILL BE DONE AT THE START OF THE EVENT TO DETERMINE WHICH CAVE HE IS IN. HIS GOAL WILL BE TO ESCAPE, HE WILL GAS DOWN PCS AND CHARGE OUT THE DOOR LEAVING THE PLAYERS TO FIGHT THE CAVE. THIS IS A BIG JUMP SCARE FOR THE LATER WEEKEND. IF HE DIES THERE HE CAN DIE IN THE CAVE**
