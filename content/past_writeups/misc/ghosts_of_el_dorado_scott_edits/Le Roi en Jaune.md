Thale:    Then how do you know that he’s indisposed?

Well he must be indisposed if he isn’t here, don’t you think?

That’s one theory.

And your theory is what? 

Perhaps he has been detained. (To Camilla.) Perhaps he’s even been arrested. Perhaps his dear sweet sister…

(Aghast.) I deny it!!

… has him arrested on the orders of his unimpeachably honest uncle. 

Thale, will you stop torturing the girl? (To Camilla.) He saw the whole damned thing, your majesty Prince Aldones has sent me here ot arrest him for it. 

As Camilla and Alar beign to argue, Thale slips away from them. By alar’s second line he begins to chant “The Unseeing Eye”.) 

You can’t arrest Thale.

I beg your pardon? I was ordered to do it by a prince of the blood. Dmanit, how can I not arrest him? But you love him. Or you did.

And you don’t love your damned brother Uoht
