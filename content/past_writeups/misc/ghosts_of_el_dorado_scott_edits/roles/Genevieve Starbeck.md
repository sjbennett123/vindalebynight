introduction: | 
  You aspired to be a singer in the Glavorn Playhouse since you were a small child. You were fascinated by the stage, and your family were wealthy patrons of the playhouse giving you access to many shows and actors. Your parents had you tutored in the art of singing and dance but acting is where your heart lays. 
  You studied with Michel Kincade at the Glavorn Playhouse for many years, and when asked, you decided to go on a traveling show that was overrun by undead necromancer Odomach one fated evening. (This is detailed in the section titled “The Great Playhouse Massacre”)
  You fled with Henri, and a few other survivors. After a time, you enlisted in the army with your friends, vowing to learn earth magics and destroy as many undead as possible. Your father protested, and has been looking for her ever since, not knowing where she disappeared to so many years ago.

**Hate Undead**: A practical encyclopedia of information about the undead and the many forms that the damnable creatures can take. You know all too well that once powered by necromantic energy they are more likely to trap other souls from going to great graveyard. This is your worst fear since the death of your parents. When talking to anyone recount facts from the section “A Dictionary of Undead”
