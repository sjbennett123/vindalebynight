title: Henri Kincade
layout: role
introduction: | 
  You are a tough and capable fighter. However, this tough facade crumbles when the time allows. You are the oldest of your 3 siblings and joined the King’s Army out of a sense of honor and duty after your parents were killed by a necromancer Odomach. (This is detailed in the section titled “The Great Playhouse Massacre”)
  You are from Ebbonmar Originally, moving to Glavorn when you turned 6 years old. Your mother Aalice and Father Michel were performers and moved the family to Glavorn to build a better life. Ten years ago, your mother and father were both killed during a traveling show. An undead horde, led by a necromancer Odomach, killed almost everyone in the theater, and turned them all into undead. (This is detailed in the section titled “The Great Playhouse Massacre”) You then put aside your ambitions in the theater and joined the King's army. Your younger siblings Carlee and Yosef also fled the performing troupe massacre, and joined the king’s army to fight the undead horde to protect the lands and people still living.
  You are focused on getting your team out of whatever trouble they get into. You are very attached to Genevieve and would not like to see anything evil befall her. You have even stated to learn earth magic as an attempt to spend more time with her.
Body: 64
