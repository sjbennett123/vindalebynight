**Ghosts of Eldorado**

**Background**: The King’s Army has heard of a dangerous infestation of Undead in an old crypt near the town… They sent a tactical unit to investigate the disturbance

**Synopsis:** 

The NPCs come to town dressed in their armor and the Kingdoms tabards, they are a jovial bunch and are kind and decent to the PCs. They come in for food, and to socialize. They drop hints that they are after some high powered undead in the region, but tell the PCs that they are well suited for this danger.  They will not want any PCs top come with them, and they are confident they can handle any issues that arise. They are all 30th level characters and are benevolent servants of the king. They have traveled together for years and know each other very well.

·    Tanguy Chavalie- 30 Earth Templar

·    Robinet Cranstian- 30 Celestial Templar

They get into this dungeon and all hell breaks loose and they TPK. One of the Kingdom army members shows up in the Circle for resurrection, and they tell the tale of what happened… **they are scared and need to roleplay being terrified at what they saw.**  Undead all around, theY tortured them prior to killing the NPC. They were the first to die. But the others were being tortured too when they died. We will draw straws to see who goes back, or the best role-player will get the nod. They can lead the players to the location but will not go inside. 

 

**Hook:** The resurrecting member of the party, coming to ask for help. 

**Costume:** Kingdom tabards, and skull masks (eventually) in the crypt, any available NPC in undead costumes.

**Set up**: NPC playing the king’s army unit will come to town to eat lunch and mingle with the players. They will pass out protectives, and make small talk with players.

Genevieve stated aspired to be a singer in the Glavorn Playhouse since she was a small child. The stage fascinated her, and her family were wealthy patrons of the playhouse so she had access to many shows and actors. Her mother and father had her train in the fine arts of singing and dance, but acting is where her heart lay.  She studied with Michel Kincade at the Glavorn playhouse for many years, and when asked, she decided to go on a traveling show that was overrun by undead necromancer Odomach one fated evening. 

She fled with Henri, and a few other survivors. She enlisted in the army with her friends, vowing to learn earth magics and destroy as many undead as possible. Her father protested, and has been looking for her ever since, not knowing where she disappeared to so many years ago.
