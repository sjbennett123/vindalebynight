requirements: Know Your Enemy has been ran

description: Life, it's hard, it makes me stronger - A warrior seeking victory - I'll push it 'til the end, push it! The Bomb Shards have to be charged and the Bloody Fist are doing so but stopping these rituals wont be as easy as originally thought….
synopsis: The Bloody Fist are preparing for their grand design of The Orcamedes Special to come to fruition. There are 10 sites of Stonewood Trees they need to use a small portion of the latent energy store in the Stonewood Tree to charge the Bomb Shards. This ritual is very dangerous and normally requires someone to bleed or die to complete it. The PCs will have to figure out how to navigate the differences of Formal Magic rituals and the more primitive and unknown “formal” magics of the Bloody Fist.
outcomes:
  - The PCs recover the charged shard and allow the ritual to be completed  
  - The PCs fail to charge the shard at this camp and must carry them to another site and pray you can charge multiple at once

rumors: | 
  There has been a sudden influx of celestial energy in the area as of the last few days. I am uncertain of what these energies are yet but I shall investigate them . It could be something with the Leylines but it feels more tied to the land with celestial energy, very concerning for me as a Celestial Formalist. I shall return with what I find out at the market gathering upcoming.
  
  Stay Safe,
  
  Magnus Kane of the Rygal Order”

running_notes: This is 1 of 10 modules, they will scale with increasing difficulty in terms of what they will fight but more importantly HOW they will fight. Each camp will have a ritual diagram with where the caster circles are and where the focus needs to stand. If the casters are hit EVERYONE in the circle suffers and takes a large hit of Arcane damage. The battles here will be very precise and thought provoking on how to approach the attack because the Bloody Fist will not leave the larger ritual circle to fight, they will force the fight inside the Ritual circle. People can enter and leave as they want since it is a “primal” circle of power “drawn” into the ground and not an official Circle of Power but the Bomb Shards can only leave the Ritual once charged. The rituals will have more casters as the modules go on and more Bloody Fist to defeat thus making the overall battle harder on a tactical approach, the cards will be the same but it will be more target that can be hit and cause the Ritual Circle wide “backlash” Magnus will accompany the PCs on the first module and explain how he thinks the ritual works so they players have a clue of how to handle the series of modules. Magnus will stay back and let them handle the fighting as this is just him observing and escorting newer and mid-level adventurers to this task. This Module will just have Grunts and Scouts fighting the PCs with one Shaman “casting” the ritual.
