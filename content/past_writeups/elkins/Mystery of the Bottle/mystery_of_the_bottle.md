title: Mystery of the Bottle
type: module
author: Michael Fife
description: Adventurer’s have a choice to drink the liquid from a mysterious blue bottle.
Background: A bottle has mysteriously appeared in the tavern with a very ominous sign attached to it “Do **NOT** Drink.” This bottle is magical in nature and seems to radiate magic. Though if someone would drink this, what would happen?
Synopsis: A blue bottle is filled with a liquid and is stuck on the counter within the tavern. Once someone takes a drink of this mysterious liquid, they will fall to the ground. Out of game, they will head to the mod shack and be blindfolded and lead to an area. Once they arrive, the player will lay down once more and un-blindfolded. They will be within the plane of air, and before them will be a Silver Cube. The area seems to be a calm point within in the stormy plane and the cube seems to be what might bring the player back to the Prime Material Plane. When the player picks up the cube, they will be taken to the front of the Tavern and will Rift in holding the cube. Ten minutes after, an elemental lord of Stone will appear and speak with the player who has the cube. He will talk about the war with the plane of Air and how the cube is an Earth Artifact that was stolen and wishes to take it back to his plane of existence. After the elemental leaves, another ten minutes will pass and the players will be attacked by Air elementals and an Air Knight, demanding the cube back. If the players gave the cube back to the Earth elemental, the Air elementals will attack the players.
Running_Notes: This is to set up elemental plot that is more or less behind the scenes. Most players don’t think there is anything going on within the planes of power simply because they are not there, but this will let them know that there is indeed something going on and it seems it will spill out upon their plane of existence. Mod will either take place within one of the clearings off of one of the two trails, within the back of the NPC shack, in Mod shack, either way the player who drank from the bottle must be blindfolded and guided by someone since there is a possibility for real danger.   If someone has a transform and it goes up, they can Rift out with or without the cube if they have the ability. If they do not want to take the cube, they can just stand around for 10 minutes and will go back to where they were when drinking the liquid.
