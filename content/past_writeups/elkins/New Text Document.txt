Requirements: Jenna Turkvos’s Ghost encounter has been ran. It is at night. 
Background: Dalantia is a place with a high standard of education. Children in Dalantia apprentice to each of the guilds for a year as schooling. During this appentichip there is much pressure on the students to outperform the members of the rival clans. Jenna Turk'vos was apprenticing to the Scholars Guild of Oilios and killed herself by jumping off a bridge. This was after years of bullying by the children of the other clans. Her spirit then became an undead known as an Allip, bent on revenge upon her classmates. She now seeks to kill her surviving classmates and has been doing a pretty good job at that. Some speculate that this vengeful spirit is her, but only her mother Miela Turk'vos is convinced of this.
One of Jenna's schoolmates Nikolao Amtistus is in town trading with the adventures when the Allip spirit of Jenna appears. He will run away and offer to sell the players information about the spirit which will lead the players to Jenna's mother. If players take Nikolao up on his offer they will be taken to the far shack where a 'house' scene will be set up and they can enter and speak with Jenna's mother. 
Jenna's mother Miela Turk'vos is mad with grief. Her only daughter Jenna Turkvos committed suicide 2 years ago and her husband Brava Turk'vos was killed in the war. Miela blames the other children who apprenticed with Jenna for her death and is glad that they are getting justice. If she is appealed to So if players go outside to find where you are coming from they may be able to identify it first day.

The Tormented :: Jenna Turk’vos the Wraith
Jenna Turkvos: If it wasn't for those bullies, you'd be living a happy life. For years you endured their mean word, insane demands, and even an occasional beating.  None of the adults ever helped, they only tried making you do the same to them. Even the nice boy Nikolao helped the bullies in their tormenting.They drove you to jump off that bridge! Now you have been given the means to ensure that they suffer and die as you have. You will not rest. You cannot rest, until every one of them know your pain. To end this pain and finally rest, you will kill Nikolao

The Tormented:: Meila Turk'vos
Your child died a few years ago, and those kids responsable are dropping like flies.  You know that it's the restless spirit of your daughter Jenny.  You can't tell people this because it will tarnish her memory. You hope she gets finished with her vengence soon so she can rest in peace and so those idiots can't do it to anyone else! Maybe the adventurers could help to put your child to rest at last? You know Jenny's spirit rests at the Bridge and only comes out at night.
Maybe these adventurers can help you to help kill Nikolao, the last of the children? If the adventurers treat the memory of your daughter with respect and ask about the good times you had with her, you will tell them about how when she was growing up when you would sing "twinkle twinkle little star"  before putting her to sleep. This always calmed her down no matter what.
________________________________________
Justice Must Be Seen: -- If you see Nikolao you will demand that he be put to death for his part in the killing of your daughter.
The song is the key – If they talk to you for a while about your daughter you tell them that 
Maybe the song isn’t the key: After the players try to use the song if they come back tell them of the Voldvay. Also tell them about the Voldvay if they ask about the drowner poster in your hall.

The Tormented:: Nikolao Amtistus
You'll never forget your first crush, Jenna Turk'vos.  Maybe you were too hard on her, but you regret everything now. Those other kids were mean, and you were just trying to fit in. You where not even that good at magic, nothing like Jenny, you just wanted her to notice you. Now your classmates are being killed by some ghost. You are scared out of your mind and have skipped school to look for help.  The worst part is it might Jenna's ghost back to get vengence, at least that's what Jenna's mother Meila says.

The Tormented:: The Voldvay
A truly malignant entity, the Vodynoy delights in attracting his victims by charm and gently murmurings, then shoves them in the water, holding their heads under as he revels in the agony of their drowning.  Alternately he sits by the waterside in the form of an old man, with a large club covered in grey ribbons.  When someone draws near out of curiosity, he clubs them to death and hurls them into the water. 
________________________________________
Supervillian : The Vodyanoy is exceptionally evil- the archetypal mad villain who delights in torture and suffering forts own sake.  He does nothing but what suits his purposes and his purposes are death and horror, particularly though the medium of water and drowning
That Sounds Like FUN!:He only respects creatures more evil than himself, and cheerfully joins in the fun when murder is proposed.  
The Curse of Dreams : Those who slay a Voldvay will have terrible nightmares. Each night roll a d6 if a 1 leave a note with the player to see plot when they wake up. Once they see plot read them a random dream.
________________________________________
Obervances: Leave his victims to drown or the Vodanoy chooses another victim – perhaps you or someone you love, so he can savor your horror.  The offerings he favors are black pigs, oil and hone- each to be thrown into ponds or rivers. 
Never wear the trapping of other deities when you swim. 
When dealing with Vodyanoy, keep a hand full of dry earth in your pocket. If this is thrown in his face, it may distract him long enough for you to run out of sight of the water where you are safe- until you come in sight of water again. 
Symbols Bones, 
Need: To see the innocent drowned 
Want: To be present for suffering and to 
Power Greater: With the permission of the drowning he can turn them into a spirit of grief and sadness. 
Power Lesser: Can sent terrible dreams to those who stand against him.

 
Costume: A fat naked old man with pallid water puckered skin and a puffy face – the image of the drowned corpse.  He can assume a more attractive form at will though his shirt tails always are dripping wet, a giveaway to his real identity. He can also assume the form of any fish or water creature
