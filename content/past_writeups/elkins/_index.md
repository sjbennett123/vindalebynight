**Magma Lord : Greater Fire Elemental**



Fire elementals go through a cycle like that of any flame. They ignite, grow in intensity then cool and fade away to be replaced with new flames. 

As they near the end of their days many of the mightiest fire elementals take up the title of magma lord and enter a stasis that they only are roused from for worthy events. For some these events are battle and carnage, for others appreciation of art and theater.



**Reason for Living**: The life of a magma lord is spent waiting for a certain activity. The magma lord only removes himself from stasis to participate in this activity.

**Stasis**: A magma lord can enter into stasis which is very similar to the effects of the Imprison spell but with 4 distinctions. (1)A Magma Lord can only enter stasis while on the plane of fire. (2)Stasis is immune to the Dispel Magic spell. (3) Stasis only be cast on self. (4)Stasis has an unlimited duration

**Near Death:** If a Magma Lord enters battle it will die at the end of it. It cannot exert itself and survive.

Place the black checker pieces on the board facing the magma lord’s seat. 

**Flee Point**: The adventurers flee using the waystone.

 **Running Notes**: Make sure that you have tags for all the items that will be needed for this module. It’s fairly intricate and has a fairly elaborate setup. The magma lord is ancient and powerful. He would be hell for the adventuers to put down. Luckily with all hope he will not be battled except for if they get too grabby.

Give the players the waystone that will allow them to travel to the plane of fire in order to match wits with the fire elemental. You are not certain about what exactly ‘ mach wits’ means but you know that some muscle will be required. 



**Waystone:** Give the large stone to the players. Tell them that to travel to the plane of fire they will need to fill the hole in the center with water and each traveler will need to say in unison “To the fire plane we go” to return they will need to place the fingers in the hole and say “to tyrra we go”

**High Pressure Sale:** You need this job to be done and are willing to be fairly pushy about it. You are willing to offer them a magic item of their choice in exchange for the frabjis which you will destroy.

**They Will have your Scent:** Once one has ventured to the plane of fire to match wits with the magma lord the guardians have the scent of him and will target him if he returns.

**Zachery the Scarred – Servant of Ludavico**



You are a servant of Ludavico the Chained one. One of the first tasks you were given was to go to the plane of fire and best the magma lord in some contest. When the magma lord was beaten you would be given permission to take one of his treasures and were to take the Frabjus a multi-part sculpture. 

You went there alone confident in the powers that you had been given by Ludavico. 

When you arrived you were overwhelmed by the onslaught of fire elementals that appeared in the chamber. Before they released you they charred your face and ensured that you would never heal as you were before your visit to the plane of fire. 



**Closetalker**: When talking, lean in uncomfortably close so that you are about 6 inches from whoever you are talking to. 

**Decorum**: You kneel before any who have the Mark of the Chained one.

**Scarred**: Your face is terribly scarred from the fire elementals. That’s why you wear the big creepy welding mask.

**Zelout**: You will talk to anyone who is not a follower of the chained one about how they should “convert” and start trying to free him as well.

**Commune with the Chained One**: Using the mark of the chained on Zachery can communicate with the chained one and ask for information and assistance. This is taxing and will only be done as a last resort.

Checkers on the plane of Fire**:: Scoarcher - Lesser Fire Elemental**



You are bound to protect the magma lord from all comers. This task is a futile one for soon he will die on his own of old age but the honor that he has brought the plane of fire demands that he be defended and the defense is such a pleasure. The intruders burn so well.



The Scoarchers are the combat part of the encounter. Pressure the players make them feel the intensity that he flames have. Rift in agressivly and in their ranks.

Mystery of the Bottle 

**Written by:** Michael Fife           **Reviewed by:** 




 **Brief**: Adventurer’s have a choice to drink the liquid from a mysterious blue bottle.




 **Pre-requisites:** A player must drink from the bottle

**Background:** A bottle has mysteriously appeared in the tavern with a very ominous sign attached to it “Do **NOT** Drink.” This bottle is magical in nature and seems to radiate magic. Though if someone would drink this, what would happen?

**Synopsis**: A blue bottle is filled with a liquid and is stuck on the counter within the tavern. Once someone takes a drink of this mysterious liquid, they will fall to the ground. Out of game, they will head to the mod shack and be blindfolded and lead to an area. Once they arrive, the player will lay down once more and un-blindfolded. They will be within the plane of air, and before them will be a Silver Cube. The area seems to be a calm point within in the stormy plane and the cube seems to be what might bring the player back to the Prime Material Plane. When the player picks up the cube, they will be taken to the front of the Tavern and will Rift in holding the cube. Ten minutes after, an elemental lord of Stone will appear and speak with the player who has the cube. He will talk about the war with the plane of Air and how the cube is an Earth Artifact that was stolen and wishes to take it back to his plane of existence. After the elemental leaves, another ten minutes will pass and the players will be attacked by Air elementals and an Air Knight, demanding the cube back. If the players gave the cube back to the Earth elemental, the Air elementals will attack the players.

 

**Outcomes**:   (1) No one drinks from the bottle (2) Player will drink from the bottle but not take the cube, rifting them back to the Prime Material Plane after so many minutes (3) Players take the cube and return, setting off the motion of events. 






 **Hook**: Blue Bottle in Tavern

**Page**: N/A

**Number of Cast Members**: 4

**Roles**: 1 Earth elemental(Sand), 4 Air Elementals (Maelstrom, 2 Lesser Air Elementals)

**Props**: Blue Bottle and Silver Cube

**Tags and Treasure**: Silver Cube (Does nothing when held by mortals. If held by someone Transformed 1xday Imprison 10xday Stone Bolt)

**Scene 1**: (OOG) Tavern

**Scene 2:** Plane of Air (walking hold)

**Scene 3:** Tyrra with or without cube

**Flee Point**: None (no combat)

 

**Non-Standard Effects**: N/A

**Rules Clarifications**: Planar Immunities/abilities

**Craftsman Information**: 

**Transformations**: Anyone with a transform will have their transform go up.

 




 **Running Notes**: This is to set up elemental plot that is more or less behind the scenes. Most players don’t think there is anything going on within the planes of power simply because they are not there, but this will let them know that there is indeed something going on and it seems it will spill out upon their plane of existence. Mod will either take place within one of the clearings off of one of the two trails, within the back of the NPC shack, in Mod shack, either way the player who drank from the bottle must be blindfolded and guided by someone since there is a possibility for real danger. 
 If someone has a transform and it goes up, they can Rift out with or without the cube if they have the ability. If they do not want to take the cube, they can just stand around for 10 minutes and will go back to where they were when drinking the liquid.





 

 

Mystery of the Bottle : **Sand - Earth Elemental Lord**

**Description:** One of many Elemental Lords. Though most seem to be solitary and stubborn, Sand is a sly and cunning elemental. He wishes to win the war for his plane and will trick the players in doing something they are NOT supposed to do. It was he who put the bottle in the Tavern to trick the players in taking the cube to further his own purposes.



**Cunning:**  Unlike most of the earth elementals, you wish to do something different. You will manipulate those that you can use like a weapon.

**Selfish:** You think only of yourself

**Greedy:** You need that cube!
 **Deflecting:** When asked about the war or what the cube is for, you will change the subject to something else, or decline outright to “protect the people”

Slick tries to be a Knight

**Written by:** Kevin Logue
 **Reviewed by:** 

 **Brief**: Slick the lizard man knight enters town and follows up on dealings from the message boards.
 **Background**: 
 **Synopsis**: Slick was one of the lizard men who entered the town and helped make the deal for Ollios to be a part of the Lizard Empire for the help of the lizard people to stand before the undead army coming. The lizards feel that they have entered into a deal with Dalantia, who has signed the Accords. There for the Lizards feel they are now a member nation of the Accords. Slick has been appointed a Knight in the city of Ollios. 

 

He will travel to the next gather to speak with many of the players and hear their concerns about some of the issues his lords and ladies have been causing on the In Game forums. Also he charged Nikkoli with Mockery of a Noble Title and will try to see justice done.




 **Hook**: None

**Page**: No

**Number of Cast Members**: 2-3

**Roles**: Slick, Isstan the Squire, Lady Varae (if Kristin is there)

**Props**: Lizard man costumes

**Tags and Treasure**: Long swords, shields, gas packets, writ stateing Slicks title and Isstan. Also a writ stateing that Slick is to investigate the mockery of a noble title as cleared by whoever.

**Scene 1**: N/A

**Scene 1 Flee**: Open Space

**Non-Standard Effects**: Magical abilities delivered via gas call.

**Rules Clarifications**: Any effect done by the lizards can be blocked by a poison shield or shield magic if any of their attacks use a spell. Any magic delivered by the poison call can be cured by a purify blood spell or dispel magic. Or a standard fix to the status ailment. 


 **Running Notes**: The people in town are going to be upset from what is going on. They are going to have a slew of questions Slick can not answer and does not know. This is going to test the waters to see if the players want to investigate if all the lizards are evil or if some are good, or if their just going to execute all the lizards they see. My hope is to get some role play going and to let the PC’s decide how they want to approach the lizard problem.

Slick tries to be a Knight**: Isstan Colden Lizard Man Squire**

It is lonely growing up alone. In the collective of the lizard folk there is not really an opportunity to individualize one’s self. But you want more, you want to be a trail blazer, you want your people to have room to grow and be happy. You were under the basic education of a mage when Slick picked you to be his squire. Your ability to listen to folks and identify the best path to follow under the law made you a great candidate. You hope to be a Knight one day, to serve with Slick and to enforce the laws of the Accords of Avalon and the laws of the Lizard Folk.

*Lady of the Lizard people. Works to expand her empire and her people’s living space. Is an astute follower of law and order. But will do everything within the structure of that order to bend the playing field to her way. She is smart, knows how to identify weaknesses in people and will exploit them without hesitancy if it brings the lizard people strength in any way. He people worship her, she is a living god among them and she will take care of them. Somehow she got lumped in with the politics plaguing the lizard people and is looking for safety for those that would still follow her among the chaos that is rising from the order.*

A Message in a Box 

**Written by:** Scott Bennett         **Reviewed by:**  Nancy




 **Brief**: The adventures find a box that contains a coded message leading them to Anil one of Haskell’s Golems.




 **Pre-requisites:** None

**Background :** In distant history there was an adventurer named Haskell. He was a close friend of Dalanto and was given Dalanto's lucky coin after a particularly close call.
 After a while he was cut down but had a time elemental transform that took effect after he died. He then went on a bunch of doctor who style adventures through the years trying to fight back the void. Haskell recently received a message requesting that he meet an old friend Norton on the plane of Regret. The message is a fake Norton is dead killed by the dragon lord Rygalis. When Haskell arrives on the plane of regret the trap is sprung. The dragon lord attacks quickly and pierces Haskell's heart with a shard of pure time magic. Rygalis then rifted away leaving Haskell to die. Haskell used his magic to send a vision to the players but he also used his time magic to send the boxes with detailed instructions being that the vision was imprecise.

**Synopsis**: One day all around the city of Olios, there were dozens of small boxes with blinking lights on them. Each blinking out some sort of message. 

Place the boxes off the beaten path. Don't be too concerned with the players seeing a specific box. The lights and word of mouth will ensure they are found. Write down where you put them so that the staff can retrieve them if they are not found. The coded message flashes out using LED's on top of the message box. The adventurers can attempt to solve it without a key but will be better suited to attempt to contact a library about the boxes for a key to the code.

**Outcomes**:   [1] Players crack the code and visit Anil at this cabin (an unexpected house call) [2] players research the library and find out that a book has been stolen. Tracking the thief down leads to me to (A wizard's Lair) after they get the key they will probably solve the puzzle.

[3] Players don't solve the puzzle and Haskell remains trapped

An Unexpected House Call

**Written by:** Scott Bennett         **Reviewed by:**  




 **Brief**: The adventurers speak to Anil the Rusty Golem about his trapped master.




 **Pre-requisites:** None

**Background :** Haskell the time lord is a master of golems. They are some of the few creatures that can last the time that he needs them to to properly battle the forces of the void . His favored protector Anil was decommissioned 37 years ago due to an unhealing injury that was inflicted during the defense of the Grey Towers of the Black Desert from the Crawling Horrors. Now the message boxes that Haskell has sent to Dalantia to call for help lead the adventures to Haskell’s door searching for answers. 

 

**Synopsis**: The adventures arrive at Anil’s home and have tea with him. He discusses the time that he spent with Haskell and regales them with stories from other worlds. He explains to the adventures that he was once a mighty warrior working to beat back the void but he was crippled in the battle for the Grey Towers. He has a box with several lights and buttons on it that he stares intently at when he is asked about the plane of grief. He explains that there is a time bubble that has encapsulated the plane of grief. Nobody gets in, nobody gets out. This time bubble has been expanding at a rapid rate both to and from the date 4/22/613. He knew that something happened there and has re-reading the notes that Haskell left for him. He will need the advetueres to travel with the aid of his mother box to several other planes to retrieve 3 keys that Haskell left for them there. Once they have these three keys they can use them with the motherbox to counteract the time barrier and save Haskell.



**Outcomes**:   [1] Adventurers accept the Rubic Box and go on the various quests to recover the keys that will enable the time barrier to be broken.

[2] Adventurers kill Anil leaving Haskell trapped on the plane of grief.

**Craftsman Information**:[

·    Golem making] – Anil is a masterful golem you have never seen such skillful golemmaking in all your years.

·    [Time Lore] A time barrier is a powerful technique that only those who have seen the end of time can master. The dangerous technique will cause a place to be locked in time but increasingly unreachable by the outside world. 

**Transformations**: No




 **Running Notes**: 



 



An Unexpected House Call: **Anil the Rusty Golem**

*You of the first and oldest of Hakell's golems and have seen the effects of that age profoundly. Haskell gave you your freedom after you were damaged in the defense of the Grey Tower from the Crawling Horrors. Haskell tried but was never able to restore the function of your left arm after it was infected by "He of the Thousand Eyes".  It hangs limply as a constant reminder of the cost of duty.*

*During your retirement you have often longed to return to the life of adventure but understand you master's wishes. He is very protective of his Golems for they each contain a portion of his life energy.  When you were watering your plants this morning you felt the familiar call of the Rubric Box. It seems that you have one last adventure in store for you. Better make this one count.* 

\~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The players will speak to you about the message that decoded from haskell’s rubric box. You will assist them in decoding it. 

\~~~

**Where was I again** -- You trail off in the end of sentences and constantly forget the name of the person that you are talking to.

**War Wounds** - Your left arm hands limply at your side. It will never heal. 

**My plants are my babies** - You love your plants, watching them grow and caring for them makes your neverending life bearable.

**All I have are Memories** -- You wish that Haskell did not decommission you, the life of adventure was the best!

The girl in the red dress -- You can read the rubric machine code at lightning speed. This will let you produce the clues to guide the players to the planar keys.

A Servant of the Fae Court

**Written by:** Michael Fife    **Reviewed by:** 




 **Brief**: A servant of the fae court is waiting for a candidate to come by that is willing to make a deal. 




 **Background:**  

**Synopsis**: Quintis has an allegiance with the Fae Court and serves Ho-fel of the Stolen Tiger Heart. He offers to sell the adventurers the protection of his master in exchange for a promise to act as a judge at the fae court if needed. If the players take him up on this offer in the next event or 2 the players are approached by the Fae and taken to a trial that the Fae are having which will force them to take sides. This will not turn out well for them in the long term.            

Ho Fel is a trickster and is most known for having stolen the heart of the silver tiger leaving him lethargic and defenseless. This heart is something that he wears around his neck as a trophy. (it's kind of gross) an often gets into altercations with the other members of the Court. If the players decide to take him up on this offer the players will be used as champions in a match to decide guilt of a crime that Ho Fel has committed. This will be at least one event after the one that we are at.


 **Outcomes**:   (1) The negotiate with Quintis and agree to a favor to be named later (2) The adventuers move on and leave Quintis to wait for another candidate

The voice is right, the lizards are the rightful rulers of this chaos filled land. These pink skinned hooch guzzling mongrals are going to destroy the land itself and the order of everything! This stupid fat merchant could not have paid his taxes, he is stuttering all over the place and your going to get to the bottom of this. You know he is guilty… none of these pink skins are truly good, you will claw the truth out of this oaf if it takes all the rage you can muster. 



**Bad Cop** : The lizardmen almost totalitarian in their respect for the law. They will grill the merchant asking leading questions till he cracks. 

·    Where is your paperwork?

·    Where are you coming from?

·    Who did you get the goods from?

·    Who did they get the goods from?

·    Why was he trying to hide some of your goods?

·    Why don’t you want to pay your taxes?

·    Are there illegal substances in there that you wanted to hide?

·    Do you like chaos, what does you think of necromancy?

·    If a small girl and boy are both about to fall off a cliff who would you save?

## Lizard Patrol finds a Tax Evader: Ssent – Lizardman Guard

*Your just trying to get by, do your job. You have only been with the guard since the lizards came to the surface last year and patrole regularly when they let you, better to stretch your legs then sit on that darn wall. You love being paird with Plasst because he always gets fired up about everything. Its more amusing then your second uncle hitting on the girls back at the pub. You’re not sure if this merchant is doing anything wrong, but why interfere with Plasst, you know he will make a decision and you will just support him and follow action. Whatever to pass the time until this guard duty is over.*

Oh Tyrra why… why are they yelling, make it stop! Where is your purse, can you just pay them off? Oh thank the elements, adventurers! Maybe they will settle this, please oh please do not let them think your breaking the law damnit!*

Lizard Patrol finds a Necromancer

**Written by:** Kevin Logue **Reviewed by:** 

 **Brief**: A patrol of lizard folk have captured a necromancer and are trying to administer justice.

 **Synopsis**: The adventurers come across a patrole of lizard folk with a man in custody. The man is guilty of necromancy. Next to the trio is a destroyed skeleton, one of the lizards is tainted and the man himself is tainted, when he tried to taint both the lizard guards after they killed his skeleton, he got one but the other had a reflect magic. The lizards are debating whether to carry out the sentence for necromancy and assult then and there or whether they should take the man back for a proper judge to carry out the sentence. But they do not know what the punishment is for necromancy or assult, they are just simple guardsmen, they know the laws but not how to enforce them. By right they may carry out low justice but not high justice. The debate is whether or not the crimes are deserving of high justice or not.

**Thossen – Guard 2**

Thossen wants to follow the law, but is a bit over zealous. He firmly believes anyone breaking the law should be held to the highest standard of punishment. Necromancy is the complete sign of not following the law! I mean come on now! That dirty necromancer tried to taint your blood, that is assult on the city guard. Assult on you!

You tainted your own blood! Now what? Oh Tyrra if you could just run the heck away… but wait there are adventurers coming. The gypsi’s in the area won’t let them kill you! Yea yea, now to talk your way out of this with that silver tongue of yours. Time to get to work.*

Ghosts of Lizard Past

**Written by:** Kevin Logue    **Reviewed by:** 



**Brief**: The players will be investigating ghostly noises of battle that occur at night.



**Synopsis**: The lizards marched from their home for a reason. That reason has not been established yet. But we know that a majority of the lizards follow Order. With the earth quakes that happened, a crevice opened leading under the crust of Tyrra and coming from it are the wails of the dead and sounds of pitched battle. Whenever the farmer of the field goes to investigate the noise he finds that his memory lapses and he finds himself walking into the light out of the crevice with no realization that he decided to climb back out.

He is nervous now, especially with all the extra planer garbage going on and his crops and field already producing at a lower yield. The farmer goes to the players and begs for assistance so that he can get back to his work.

When the players call out the proper phrase, the battle stills and a ghost of a lizard man appears. He will notify the players that this is a war from not long ago, a battle between warriors of chaos and order. All the spirit knows is he entered the battle and has not stopped fighting or dieing until these folks pressed into this bubble of spirit and dream. The spirit will inform the players that to be put to rest, need the players to find him a familiar form to go to. But to take him from the field he can temporarily travel with a Player Character. If the payers consent the spirit will flow into one of them that they choose. 

Any players with CO’s: Relating to spirit or dream will realize this was a tramatic life experience and has trapped many dead spirits into an eternal struggle and the players interference are helping the spirits find rest. That there is also elemental forces at play fueling this activity.

 

The players will clear three rooms like this, the first two rooms each ending with a lizard man spirit. The final room will have a spirit of an order elemental in the form of a lizard. This was a warrior who had been transformed when he entered the field of battle, but because of the ghost war, has not yet died to permanently transform.

 



**Outcomes:** (1) The players kill Gurdy and nothing happens.(2)The players flee the module.(3)The players can choose who to give the spirits to. If they go to Fife’s faction, then the lizards should get a small boost. Ten gets more confident in his declarations and becomes less crazy but more calculating in his attempts for power.(4)If the players give the spirits to Slick and Vera then they bolster the resistance movement inside the Lizard Folk and will help push Slick and Vera to abandon the crazy man Ten.

 

 



**Hook**: Farmer Gurdy

**Page**: No

**Number of Cast Members**: 5 to start, 3 during the whole engagement.

**Roles**: Farmer Gurdy, Ghost of Zzlazil, Ghost of Sshep, Ghost of Zzeel

**Props**: Black Tabards (Chaos), White Tabard (Order), Green Tabard (Lizard Man), single lines of phrase on written pieces of paper.

**Tags and Treasure**: N/A

**Scene 1**: Players climb into the crevice

**Scene 1 Flee**: Entrance

**Non-Standard Effects**: Ghosts will inhabit the players

**Rules Clarifications**: Ghosts will inhabit 2 of the players as they enter the battle scene. These players will have static cards and will turn into NPC’s attacking the players. If they are taken down they will dissipate as a ghost and reform to attack their friends again.


 **Running Notes**: Notify players of non-standard effects such as the inhabitation. The other three NPC’s should have the same stat cards as the ghosted players. The objective is to reset hard and fast like a field of war would be, low stats, quick deaths. The players on each reset will drop another line of a phrase the players will need to piece together in order to say out loud to by pass the vision of battle to the next scene. If they players try to stabize their friends, nothing they do will snap their friends out of the ghost presence. If they leave with the player inhabited they immediately enter their death count. When Lifed, the ghost is gone, returned to the ghost battle below.

 




**Phrase 1:** 

- Lizard progress is neither     automatic nor inevitable
- Every step toward the goal of     justice

*You are a soldier and marched when it was your time to do so to protect your people. The armies of chaos were marching on your people and you would be a wall to intercept them. You realize you’re a ghost now… but you can not rest until you know your people are safe, that your years of battle against a faceless foe are ended. To do that you need to be carried to the Lacerta Vira… the lizard folk. You believe in the establishment of Order, harsh, cold order at any costs. And the protection of that order and the establishment.*

*You were an officer in the army of the Lacerta Vira. Your people, who were always happy in the dark dampness of the Under World below the crust of Tyrra, spent years skirmishing with creatures of the below world. You were a civil people, years of existence had taught your people that the only way to crawl out of the dark was to establish law, put order and direction to a world of chaos. But recently, a new faceless enemy had appeared, pushing at the monsters and critters you had so easily kept at bay. It felt like chaos was hovering over their shoulders, driving these beasts on.*

 

*You wished to be removed from this field of battle and given back to your people to see them safe. You are also sure that removal from this place should destroy the war of spirits.*

That is why you had an Order Transform cast on your spirit. You do not know why you did not transform when you suffered your permanent death… if your even dead. But you know that the earth quakes brought forth the drive of the critters of the under dark to drive at your people, to take your land and drive you from your strong holds. What those creatures did not know is that as they fought your kin, the walls of your city was crumbling. The shifting land was destroying years of a civilization content to be left alone.* 

 

*You want to be returned to your people, to see that they are made safe and continue to fight for them if that is the destiny laid out for you.*

**Brief:** A Dream Imp is in the woods alone. 



**Requirements:** 1 dream imp
 **Background**: A dream imp is flitting through the woods, he wants to go home.

**Synopsis**: A dream imp materialized on Tyrra floating around using their connection to the dream plane to sooth the nightmares of the folks who have suffered in the region. Due to this the little guy can’t get home, he is out of juice but would like to go home.

 

The players can banish him then and there and that will send him home. Or they can play a game that utilizes their imagination that will pull energy from the dream plane and the little sprite can renew his skills and rift home.

 

If the players agree to renew his skills, he will form them up in a circle and play the story game. The players will each have a sentence, and the next player in the circle must build off the previous sentence to create a story. The players must do this for 8 cycles creating a great tale. 

 

If the players can do this for 20 cycles then they will turn their dream imp friend into a lesser dream elemental and he will promise them a future favor to be had.

**Outcomes:**

1. Players kill the imp  
2. Players banish the imp
3. Players follow through with the story

The Hero Returns

**Written by:** Chris Colland   **Reviewed by:** [Name]




 **Brief**: A powerful but torn spirit is sensed in the Earth Circle of the Oilios tavern. A man named Rufus resurrects from the circle with scattered memories of being killed by Dakos but the reasons are unclear. 






 **Requirements:** The events of Friday night have taken place and the Rygal Order is established in Dalantia

 

**Synopsis**: Rufus Algerius, the prince of the far off land Narthiel on the other side of Briarwood (#58 on Avalon map) to west of Dalantia, has been searching for assistance in dealing with the Order of Rygal for years now. The Order besieged his homeland and when victory was certain he was attacked by the Dragonlord Rygalius who cast him into the plane of Time in a prison. For 20 years he remained in a prison that kept him from aging and sleeping, since time was irrelevant on the Time plane Rufus slowly went insane and had his memories locked away in his prison. One day Rufus awoke from his trance in his prison and discovered his father's sword was missing; a voice spoke to him and freed him from his prison. Since his escape by mysterious powers he has been hunting the Order of Rygal but with fragmented memories.

 

**Outcomes**: 1) Players choose to resurrect and listen to Rufus's story. 2) Players ignore his spirit in circle.

·    Once imprisoned in a time plane, your body **does not** require sleep, rest, food, water. The needs of a body due to the effects of time such as digestion are suspended and irrelevant.

**Transformations**: None

 




 **Running Notes**: This encounter is meant to introduce a NPC for the PC's that will aid them when the Rygal Order becomes a problem. Rufus will seem very crazy and untrustworthy at first but once we he regains his memories will be a library of information on the Rygal Order for the PC's. This encounter should not involved combat unless Rufus is attacked in which case he will defend himself with spells.

 





**The Hero Returns :: Rufus Algerius**

 

*You have suffered pain and unexplainable madness from your imprisonment. The 20 years in the prison of the Time plane has driven you insane and locked away your memories, clouding your past and darkening your future. Answers only lead to more questions, nothing makes sense. It must be that Order of Rygal's fault. But you remember how corrupting they are. At first they were nice and helpful then it was a monstrous transformation into tyranny of undeath.*



**Rufus Roleplay:** 

·    Rufus is very scattered minded currently. Most of his memories are locked away within his mind leaving him sounding crazy when he tries to talk to people in fragmented words. 

·    His kingdom was besieged by the Rygal Order many years ago, while they won the battle they lost ultimately because the Count (Rufus's father) was killed and Rufus was cast into a prison away from the kingdom. 

·    When asked about why Narthiel was attacked by the Rygal Order, you can't remember why the war was started.

·    When asked where you came from, answer with the land of Narthiel but you don't remember details about it.

·    Talk about needing your sword **Nardor**. Act as if you are in withdrawal of its presence almost like a drug. Claim it will solve everything if it's found. This claim will sound mad, play it up as so.

·    When asked about its nobility, you only remember your father was Baron but you are unsure of his condition. If pressed about your father start to become defensive and emotional about him.

·    If asked who the leader of the Rygal Order was at the time of your attack, it was not Dakos.

·    The goal here is to leave doubt in the players' minds that Rufus is really who he says he is. Also, Rufus is to appear very crazy and disconnected from normal conversation and thought. This is due to his time spent in the Time Prison.

·    **Do not lead the players that the Order of Rygal is evil!** Allow players to draw their own conclusions, the Order of Rygal may be/seem a much better way of life than Dalantian life to some.

Some speculate that this vengeful spirit is her, but only her mother Miela Turk'vos is convinced of this.

One of Jenna's schoolmates Nikolao Amtistus is in town trading with the adventures when the Allip spirit of Jenna appears. He will run away and offer to sell the players information about the spirit which will lead the players to Jenna's mother. If players take Nikolao up on his offer they will be taken to the far shack where a 'house' scene will be set up and they can enter and speak with Jenna's mother. 

Jenna's mother Miela Turk'vos is mad with grief. Her only daughter Jenna Turkvos committed suicide 2 years ago and her husband Brava Turk'vos was killed in the war. Miela blames the other children who apprenticed with Jenna for her death and is glad that they are getting justice. If she is appealed to So if players go outside to find where you are coming from they may be able to identify it first day.

The Tormented**:: Meila Turk'vos**

Your child died a few years ago, and those kids responsable are dropping like flies. You know that it's the restless spirit of your daughter Jenny. You can't tell people this because it will tarnish her memory. You hope she gets finished with her vengence soon so she can rest in peace and so those idiots can't do it to anyone else! Maybe the adventurers could help to put your child to rest at last? You know Jenny's spirit rests at the Bridge and only comes out at night.

Maybe these adventurers can help you to help kill Nikolao, the last of the children? If the adventurers treat the memory of your daughter with respect and ask about the good times you had with her, you will tell them about how when she was growing up when you would sing "twinkle twinkle little star" before putting her to sleep. This always calmed her down no matter what.



**Justice Must Be Seen:** -- If you see Nikolao you will demand that he be put to death for his part in the killing of your daughter.

**The song is the key** – If they talk to you for a while about your daughter you tell them that 

**Maybe the song isn’t the key**: After the players try to use the song if they come back tell them of the Voldvay. Also tell them about the Voldvay if they ask about the drowner poster in your hall.

A truly malignant entity, the Vodynoy delights in attracting his victims by charm and gently murmurings, then shoves them in the water, holding their heads under as he revels in the agony of their drowning.

The Formian Pet

**Written by:** Scott Bennett **Reviewed by:** Kathryn Rose




 **Brief**: Adventurers encounter a group of Formians Warriors who attempt to negotiate by telepathically speaking through a captured human.




 **Requirements:** None

**Background**: The Formian colony has expanded and is intruding upon the adventurers’ lands. The Formians have tired of constantly being defeated by adventurers. To avoid more conflict they have captured an unsuspecting townsperson, Marcus Henke, and began feeding him a paste that will allow them to telepathically speak through him.

**Synopsis**: The Formians have been waiting for their opportunity to speak to the adventurers and attempt diplomacy for months. Using their hive mind the Formians are going to use Marcus as a mouthpiece to speak to the adventurers and offer them a variety of "Formian Treasures". If the adventurers leave the caves without battle the hive will know that the adventurers can be bought and will always offer whatever “treasure” the players have accepted in their future dealings. If negotiations erupt in violence the Formians will fight to the death to protect their "Pet".

**Outcomes**: (1) The Formain attempt at negotiation fails and there is a mass of combat. (2) The adventurers reach an agreement with the Formians and set the tone for the future. 






 **Hook**: Adventurers exploring "The Wilds" stumble upon a Formian mine.

**Page**: No

**Number of Cast Members**: 3-8

**Roles**: Formian Warrior (1-5), Marcus Henke(1), Ogre Corpse(1)

**Props**: Crate, dirt, a bag of washers

**Tags and Treasure**: Gems, Evaluate Items, Components, Corpse of an ogre warrior, paste of stickiness

**Scene 1**: (OOG) A large room with a crate or chair in the center. (IG)A cave deep in the wilds.

**Flee Point**: (OOG) The door to the room. (IG) Leads out of the cave to safety.

**Non-Standard Effects**: None

**Rules Clarifications**: None

**Craftsman Information**: None

**Transformations**: None




 **Running Notes**: The Formians are a tough combat challenge. Scale them up to the “greater formain” role if they will be too weak or if you have far fewer cast members than PC’s on the encounter. You can replace the Ogre with any other costumed NPC that you have around the NPC shack. The essence of the encounter is capturing the alien nature of the Formians by showing how they negotiate. 

This can also be ran as a link between other encounters because of how little setup/tear down that is required.



**The Formain Pet:: Formian Warrior**

*Your life has been spent in the darkness of the hive. It consists of the same routine digging of new tunnels, and fighting off intruders to the marvelous underhive. All of this is in the service to the great hive queen. Now the queen has demanded that the hive expand. This expansion has brought you into contact with the soft-skins of the above-world. These interactions are often violent and always costly to the hive. Possibly instead of fighting the soft skinned creatures it would be better to discuss the ceding of their land to the hive voluntarily with none of these costly battles.To this end you and your brothers have captured and cared for one of the soft skinned creatures to use as a mouthpiece. You have kept him alive by feeding him a steady diet of grub paste which has made him a member of the hive. Hopefully you will be able to convince any intruders that the hive is best left in peace.* 



You will negotiate with the adventures and attempt to convince them to leave the hive in peace. If they agree to this then you will be able to solidify the hive’s hold on the area. The pain that the Formain Telepathy causes is of no concern to the hive for the subject will continue to function.



**Formain Telepathy**: Feeding a human grub paste links them to the hive mind. Beings that are not of the same Insect-like physiology as Formians are subjected to indescribable pain whenever this link is used. Out of Game, the Formain Telepathy is represented by one of the Formain Warriors whispering into the human with a connection to the hive mind's ear and the Human will relay the message. Humans do not remember the words that they say when they are being controlled by the Formian Telepathy. 

**Formian Treasures:** The Formains attempt to give the adventurers some manner of ‘treasure’ to allow the hive to expand without incident. These items are actually worthless but are seen as valuable from the perspective of the Formians. Each Formain Warrior should choose an item from the Formian Treasures below or make one up keeping in mind that it needs to be odd and essentially worthless.

 **○** An exquisite mound of dirt **○** An ogre corpse of a the finest vintage **○**A generous bag of shiny circles (Washers) **○**A wonderful rendition of a classic human song (Happy Birthday)

**
**

**Formian Warrior**

**Silent Killers**: Formian Warriors cannot speak due to their advanced hive mind. All of their communication with the surface races is through clacking mandibles and frantic gestures. Formians do not understand human concepts such as mercy and friendship but they know that the soft skins do and will try to use these weaknesses against them for the glory of the hive.

**Protect the Queen****:** A Formian warrior only lives to serve the hive and it’s queen.

**Group Mind (NERO 9’th)**: Some types of creatures notably some giant insects have a group mind. Each creature’s mind is but part of a larger whole. What one of them sees or experiences, they all know; however, Holds cannot be called for the players to converse. Creatures that are part of a Group Mind are immune to mind control affects. An Awaken spell will not free them of the group mind’s control. Mind controlling Effects for Group Mind are defined as: Shun, Calm, Sleep, Dominate, Enslavement, Charm, Fear and Vampire Charm.



**Costume**: Red face with antennae , Brown Tabard

**Treasure:** 1 Gold Piece or Formal Component per reset

**Resets**: (3)– “I come from the Depths” Down the hall.       **Cooldown**: 30 seconds 
 **Descriptive Phrase**: Giant Red and Black Ant 

**Type**: Insectoid      **Intellect**: Normal (Group Mind)

**Weapon Attack**: Bite at “10-Normal” 

**Packet Delivered Attack**: None 

**Body Points**: 10 

**Defenses**: Threshold 5, Natural Armor 10, Escape Pin/Bind/Web/Confine

**Immune To**: Sleep, Charm, Fear, Enslavement 

**Weaknesses**: None 

**Special Abilities**: Group Mind, Suicide Ability, Superhuman Strength +8



**The Formain Pet:: Marcus Henke the Prisioner**

*It seems like an eternity since these horrible creatures captured you. Weeks, months, years, who knows down here in the dark and with their clacking and their smell, oh Tyrra, that smell is like old socks. The worst part of this whole mess is that they only feed you this horrible white paste that tastes like almonds. The last several weeks you have been blacking out and waking up with the most terrible headache. You think you must be going mad down here in these caves.* 

*You want your life back. You want freedom on the surface again. When you see people again, you know that they will rescue you from these monsters.*



The formains will be speaking through you to the adventures using the **Formian Telepathy** and offering them worthless treasures. Marcus wants to be freed but needs the adventurers help.



**Formian Telepathy**: Feeding a human grub paste links them to the hive mind. Beings that are not of the same Insect-like physiology as Formians are subjected to indescribable pain whenever this link is used. The Formain Telepathy is represented Out of Game by one of the Formain Warriors whispering into the human with a connection to the hive mind's ear and the Human will relay the message. Humans do not remember the words that they say when they are being controlled by the Formian Telepathy. Humans that are being controlled by Formain Telepathy will have one accent for when the human is in control and a different one when the Formains are in control.



·    The encounter running well really hinges on your skill at improvisation and the switch between when you are controlled by the Formians and when you are free to speak as Marcus. 

·    Marcus does not know that the Formians are speaking through him so he is going to be surprised and need to figure out what the Formians are doing by talking to the adventurers.

**The Formain Pet:: Ogre Corpse**

*It seemed like such a good idea to be exploring the darkness of the dungeon and then BOOM it was all over. The chittering and clacking of their inhuman bodies pouring out of the depths filled your ears. The insect like Formians quickly overwhelm you, your massive strength seeming to work against you as they stab you with their long terrible mandibles. The world went black.*



**Notes**: You are mostly window dressing for the encounter.

**Written by:** Nancy McSwiney      **Reviewed by:** [Name]



**Brief**: PCs find two small yellow jewels; they are the first in a series of clues to a minor Ka'citus artifact.

**Requirements:** None

**Synopsis**: PCs stumble upon a small cave that is dimly lit by phosphorescent fungi. There is nothing of particular note in it except for two small, chipped yellow jewels. PCs may find and carry these off with no consequences.

**Outcomes**: (1.) PCs find stones and pocket them. 2.) PCs do not find stones; they are left for the next group. 



**Hook**: Adventure card.

**Page**: Yes.

**Number of Cast Members**: 1

**Roles**: Marshal      

**Props**: Two small chipped yellow stones, as the Dalantian gypsies of House Ka'citus wear upon their faces

**Tags and Treasure**: Two small chipped yellow stones, tagged

**Scene 1**: Card location

**Flee Point**: None

**Non-Standard Effects**: None

**Rules Clarifications**: Craftsman skills will not help you find these. You must manually search for the stones.

Ka'citus Treasure Hunt Enc. 2



**Written by:** Nancy McSwiney      **Reviewed by:** [Name]



**Brief**: PCs find two small yellow jewels; they are the first in a series of clues to a minor Ka'citus artifact.

 

**Requirements:** “Ka'citus Treasure Hunt Enc. 1” has already been run.

 

**Synopsis**: A Goldsmithing Guild merchant comes into town and has one of the Ka'citus artifact gems on their person for sale. PCs may purchase the gem then and there for 5 gold or come to the Goldsmithing Guild later and try to buy it, after which the price will ratchet up to 30 gold (one of the more experienced artisans, Harin Turk'vos, will recognize it for what it is, a valuable piece of history).

 

**Outcomes**: 

1.) PCs purchase stone from Goldsmithing Guild merchant for 5 gold.

2.) PCs purchase stone from Goldsmithing Guild proper for 30 gold.

3.) PCs do a favor for Harin Turk'vos in exchange for the stone. (See “Harin's Favor” encounter).

4.) PCs choose not to acquire stone. The “Ka'citus Treasure Hunt” series cannot be completed without this stone.


**
**

 

**Hook**: Goldsmithing Guild Merchant (Argus Di'mondus)

**Page**: Yes.

**Number of Cast Members**: 2

**Roles**: Argus Di'mondus, Harin Turk'vos.

**Props**: One small chipped yellow stone, as the Dalantian gypsies of House Ka'citus wear upon their faces

**Tags and Treasure**: One small chipped yellow stone, tagged

 

**Scene 1**: Goldsmithing Guild merchant Argus Di'mondus comes into town looking to sell some extra supplies, mostly gems that did not make the grade for crafting by the guild's artisans. One of the gems is a Ka'citus artifact piece that Argus, being a very new member of the guild, does not recognize as such. All stones are priced to sell and this one is only 5 gold.

 

**Scene 2:** If PCs have seen the gems from “Ka'citus Treasure Hunt Enc. 1” they will recognize this gem as part of the same “set.” If they have not, they will simply think it is a yellow gem unless they have the Craftsman Information discussed below. They make choose to purchase this gem for 5 gold, or haggle it down to 3 gold, while Argus is in town.

 

**Scene 3:** This scene is optional depending on PC actions. If PCs choose to “come back” for the stone later, they must go to the Goldsmithing Guild, where one of the higher ranking guild members, Harin Turk'vos, has gotten a better look at the Ka'citus artifact. Harin informs the PCs that it is a valuable artifact and that it is technically priceless, but since it is obviously not of importance to the Turk'vos family perhaps he will entertain offers. At this point, PCs can offer Harin 30 gold or more and he will accept. Harin will also accept PCs doing him some favors in exchange for the stone (see “Harin's Favor” encounter).

 

**Flee Point**: None

**Non-Standard Effects**: None

**Rules Clarifications**: None

**Craftsman Information**: Any character versed in Dalantian lore or Jewelry will recognize these stones to be very old indeed; they are from when the houses first divided themselves into the (formerly 10, now 9) colors that they are currently.

**Transformations**: None

 

**Running Notes**: This mod should be run only after “Ka'citus Treasure Hunt Enc. 1” has been completed. 



Ka'citus Artifact Enc. 3

1.)PCs incapacitate Wren and take the hairband

Harin's Favor: Ka'citus Treasure Hunt enc 4

**Written by:** Nancy McSwiney        **Reviewed by:** [Name]

 **Brief**: PCs must run some errands for Harin Turk'vos, a mid-ranking member of the Goldsmith's Guild. Harin gives the PCs a package to deliver to the riverport north of Oilios, with instructions not to open it as it is easily damaged. PCs must hand this package off to Captain Jenner, who is headed to Opalucet on his ship *River Otter*.

After PCs hand the package off to the captain and return to the Goldsmiths Guild, Harin tells them good, they're just in time for another chore. If PCs refuse, he says okay, but the jewel will still be 25 gold. 

 

**Requirements:** None

 

**Outcomes**: 

1.) PCs deliver package without looking inside of it and return to Harin and continue helping him in eventual exchange for the Ka'citus stone.

2.) PCs discover contents of package are evidence of an illicit romance, blackmail Harin with it with great success

3.)PCs choose to tell Harin's superiors about the deal; Kaelit Dimond'us (head of the Goldsmith's Guild) wants to keep a hold of the stone until its purpose becomes more clear. This is non negotiable and bribing her will result in ire. PCs may return to Kaelit after they have found the Ka'citus skull with the missing gemstones (see “Finding History”), after which she will hand it over, telling them to take it to Knave Lysander Kaze Ka'citus, the current head of House Ka'citus (see “Presenting History”)

Ka'citus Treasure Hunt Enc. 5

 

**Written by:** Nancy McSwiney       **Reviewed by:** 

 

**Synopsis**: Oilios' Mining Guild has heard about the furor surrounding the found skull of Ka'cito, one of the founders of the nine Houses. They have dug through their rough gems and rock and found the last three stones that were originally embedded into the skull. They send a representative to Oilios to find the adventurers that found the other gems and skull so that they may all watch the completion of an important artifact.

**Scene 2:** Kaelit Di'mondus greets the PCs; she has obtained the skull from the Sorceror's Guild, telling them that it will be restored to its former glory. She affixes the rest of the gems to the skull and promounces it complete. Afterwards, she asks Aree to send word to Knave Lysander Kaze Ka'citus, to tell him that Ka'cito's skull has been restored.

**Scene 3:** The PCs are given a small chest full of valuables for their invaluable assistance in procuring this treasure. They also have the grudging favor of House Ka'citus and the Sorceror's Guild (for finding this artifact and allowing them to record it.)

Dire Wolves

**Written by:** Nancy McSwiney       **Reviewed by:** Scott Bennett

 

**Synopsis**: The wolves are pushing into Oilios' boders because an exploding bugbear population is driving them out of their hunting grounds. They are hungry and distressed and will be aggressive.You are intended to be a nice bit of combat for the adventures and to start them questioning why there are wolves in the area that didn’t have them before. 



**Hungry:** You are prone to attack the more “delicious” looking adventuers first. You will also be placated with a well placed steak or treat. 

**Needlessly Aggressive:** Once you start in on giving someone the business don’t relent. Be as fearsome as you know a wolf to be. 

**Howl**: Always take the time to give a good howl when you see a victim to strike the fear of the pack in 

their heart. 

**Vampire Control:** Vampires can control dire wolves. A wolf knows this and keeps the hell away from those monsters. Once you are ensnared there is no escape.

**Blame the Dog**

**Written by**: Nancy McSwiney      **Reviewed by:**



**Brief:** Some of the younger hunters have become lax in training their hunting dogs. The undisciplined animals have been running amok and killing livestock instead of game, and the hunters do not want to fess up and pay recompense to the herders.
 **Requirements:** One representative from each guild, dead sheep, hunting dog.
 **Background**: While hunting Hahvar Kris’alis dog killed Miriskma’s sheep. 
 **Synopsis**: Mirishka Opalis a member of the Farmers and Herders Guild and Hahvar Kris'alis, a member of the Hunters and Trappers Guild are loudly arguing in the tavern about the death of Mirishka’s sheep. If PCs do not respond within a few minutes then Mirishka Opalis stands up in a huff and begins railing to the nearest PC about what a fat-headed dummy Hahvar Kris'alis is. If PCs still refuse to get involved at this point then the mod will be considered dropped for the day and the situation will escalate. 

When the Adventueres speak to Mirishka and Hahvar, Mirishka will take them to the dead sheep in her field. It has been dead since the evening before and it looks like a small predator or two has gnawed on it in the meantime. The most notable wound is on its neck, and the wool in that area is stained with blood.  If PCs look more closely, they can part the wool in that area and find a broken-off tooth shard in it. Hahvar will proclaim that Mirishka is trying to blame the work of wolves on him, and that she has had it in for him for months.  

If PC characters are disrespectful to either Hahvar or Mirishka they will be snapped at by all both of them. They are having what amounts to an extended family dispute and will not tolerate “outsiders” dissing their family members, no matter how badly they speak of each other in the meantime.

All signs point to Bosh as the culprit, and Hahvar is going to suffer the consequences: Mirishka's sharp tongue and becoming the laughing-stock of his guild.
 After Hahvar slinks off with Bosh, Mirishka has the PCs come with her to the local Farmers and Herders Guild outpost and tells those in charge of what has transpired. PCs are rewarded with 5 silver apiece and the Farmers and Herders Guild's good favor.
 **Outcomes:[1]** PCs accuse both Mirishka and Hahvar of setting each other up. neither NPC trusts those PCs whatsoever, and trust is diminished for all PCs for the season. [2]PCs take Mirishka's side but find no evidence to back up their claims. Hahvar no longer trusts those PCs and their trust of PCs overall is diminished for the season. [3] PCs take Hahvar's side but find no evidence to back their claims. Mirishka no longer trusts those PCs and their trust of PCs overall is diminished for the season. [4] PCs take Mirishka's side and find evidence to back up their claims. Mirishka is grateful and rewards PCs with a small favor from her guild (Farmers and Herders) and some treasure. This guild will also be more inclined to like/trust PCs as a whole. Hunters and Trappers Guild pays recompense to the Farmers and Herders Guild; Hahvar is resentful of the PCs and if encountered again, will badmouth them.

**Hook:** Mirishka and Hahvar arguing in the tavern, dragging PCs into it.
 **Page**: Yes. Unless something goes horribly, horribly wrong, this is a non-combat mod.
 **Number of Cast Members**: 3
 **Roles**: Mirishka Opalis, Hahvar Kris'alis, Hahvar's hunting dog Bosh.
 **Props**: Dead sheep, broken off tooth.
 **Tags and Treasure**: 5 silver per adventurer, commendation by appropriate guild depending on course of action. Guild commendation is good for one small favor per adventurer, such as tracking down a specific beast or providing food for an IG event.
 **Scenes:** The tavern, Mirishka’s field, the Farmer and Herder Guild outpost
 **Flee Point**: None, PCs can refuse to continue assisting at any time.
 **Non-standard effects**: None.
 **Rules Clarifications**: Go over Craftsman: Other skill rules with the PCs and NPCs before this mod is run.
 **Craftsman Information**: Animal knowledge of any kind will help in this mod. *Tracker*: The footprints around the dead sheep are Mirishka's, Bosh's, and that of a fox or something similar that scavenged the corpse. No large predators have been in the area recently enough to have killed Mirishka’s sheep.  Tracking will determine the time passed and the nature of the tracks (canine) but not the specific creature. PCs with Tracking of any level can determine that there are human and canine footprints near the sheep.  PCs with Tracking  up to 4 can determine  the footprints are not wolf prints as Hahvar says they are.  PCs with Tracking above 4 will know that the prints belong to Mirishka, Bosh, and a fox that came by in the night to scavenge the corpse.
 **Transformation**: no.

 Blame the Dog : **Mirishka Opalis**

 **Motive**: Wants to find out who has killed her sheep, as they are her livelihood. Suspects Hahvar because she knows that he hunts in the woods nearby and besides, she doesn't like his stupid face.
 **Background**: In her early twenties. Leading member of the local Farmers and Herders Guild; has some small clout as a result. Has had small disputes with Hahvar before; this is the first one in which any creature has come to harm.


**
**

**Card**: 10 level celestial scholar
 **Treasure**: 5 silver per PC, which she obtains from her guild. If the PCs just kill her they will get 2 silver and a plain dagger.

 Blame the Dog : **Hahvar Kris'alis**

 **Motive**: Wants to hide that his errant hunting dog is responsible for killing Mirishka's sheep, as he does not want to suffer the wrath of his guild. And anyway he lost most of his coin to her a few days ago anyway, she can use that to buy a new sheep.
 **Background**: In his late teens. New member of the Hunters and Trappers Guild and is still under scrutiny. Did not properly train his hunting dog, who decided that a sheep was easier prey than a deer or boar. Has had scuffles with Mirishka because he often takes shortcuts through her property.


**
**

**Card**: 5th level fighter
 **Treasure**: None.

 Blame the Dog : **Hahvar's hunting dog Bosh

 Motive:** Likes to play chase.
 **Background**: Hahvar's hunting dog, who is nearly grown but still very puppy-like. Not trained properly yet, so does not know to hunt only wild game. Attacked and killed one of Mirishka's sheep; broke off part of his tooth in the process.


**
**

**Card**: Dog, 1st level.
 **Treasure**: Leather collar. No value, except sentimental to Hahvar.




Blame the Dog : **Dead Sheep**

 Has part of Bosh's tooth embedded in it's neck. Is dead and has no motivation.

Wayward Wyvern

 

**Written by: Nancy McSwiney**        **Reviewed by:** [Name]

 **Brief**: PCs find a wyvern chick in the bushes; it is in rough shape.


 **Requirements: n/a**

**Background:**

**Synopsis**: A recent windstorm has swept a wyvern chick out of their mountainside nest. PCs encounter the baby crying in the bushes; it is obviously cranky and hungry and will try to bite whoever comes near. As the PCs begin to interact with the baby its cries grow louder and the parent swoops in. Parent goes straight for the PCs that are nearest to her chick and is KBA. If PCs manage to get more than 50 yards from the chicks in any direction she will leave them be. Parent will gather her chick and carry it off to the nest in her claws if left be. If the parent is killed the chick will wail and cry and carry on; it will die of exposure if left be and will not go with PCs willingly. If PCs leave and come back later at any time the baby will have died; it was on its last leg when found and the added stress of the encounter has killed it. 

 

**Outcomes**:

1. Parent is killed, chick is killed.
2. Parent is killed, chick dies of exposure. 
3. Parent is killed, PCs find way to capture/incapacitate chick. The moment it is no longer incapacitated it will cry and struggle, hurting and then killing itself in the process. In other words, you can't fucking adopt this baby so stop trying to.
4. Parent lives and takes baby to safety in mountainside nest.



 

**Hook**: PCs hear cries of some small creature in the bushes nearby.

**Page**: No.

**Number of Cast Members**: 3

**Roles**: Wyvern parent (2 NPCs), wyvern chick 

**Props**: n/a

**Tags and Treasure**: 3 components from parent wyvern (all dropped if it flies off with chick).

**Flee Point**: 50 yards in any direction from wyvern chick

**Non-Standard Effects**: None

**Rules Clarifications**: None

**Craftsman Information**: Animal Lore or Healing Craftsmans of any kind will tell the PCs that this chick is too far gone to save and that nature must take its course.

**Transformations**: None

**Running Notes**: The PCs are NOT getting this thing as a pet. It cannot be tamed nor can its parent. Be firm.

Sword of Ky’lo

**Written by:** Michael Fife     **Reviewed by:** 




 **Brief**: After being harassed by the followers of Ky’lo, Nevaeh will finally be confronted by Canus **Antracit'us.** 




 **Pre-requisites:** Players must have the sword of **Antracit'us, Kylo followers have harassed the bearer of the sword**

**Background:** The sword that was found in the old **Antracit'us keep actually belonged to Ky’lo himself to be given to him when he returned from the plane of death. Canus Antracit’us has discovered it went missing and is now on a mission to bring it back and as well as the person who took it.**

**Synopsis**: Followers of Ky’los have been coming into town on a mission to find Nevaeh. Once found, they start to harass her about the great peril she is in. The followers will harass her throughout the day until Canus shows up with his entourage in the evening and demands his family’s weapon. Canus will try to take Nevaeh with him even if he has the sword. The adventurers will have to rescue Nevaeh if she is taken at the old **Antracit'us keep where they found the sword in the first place.**

**Outcomes**:   (1) Players fight off Canus and his minions (2) Canus takes the sword and retreats

(3) Canus takes Nevaeh and the players need to rescue her. 






**
**

**Hook**: Ky’lo cultists

**Page**: no

**Number of Cast Members**: all

**Roles**: Canus **Antracit'us, Undead, Ky’lo Cultist**

**Flee Point**: Back outside the cabin playing as the keep.

**Craftsman Information**: none

**Transformations**: None.

 




 **Running Notes**: If there are no players in the mod shack, the mod will be ran there just like the Treasure in the Castle module since the players will be returning to the Antracit’us keep. If the cabin is occupied, the players will be taken around the field towards the NPC shack, around close to the lake and towards the mod shack and around it towards the field. Both scenarios will end at the field between the two trails. Mod shack (if not in use) should be set up before game on so we do not have Leah waiting for too long waiting for everyone to get ready and have the players come rescue her.





 

 

The Sword of Ky’lo: Canus Wildcairn Antracit’us 

 

**Description:** You are charged by Ky’lo himself with watching over the keep but were away on ‘lich business’ and Ky’lo’s blade was given to an unbeliever by that foolish golem.

He will never forgive you abandoning your duties in order to preside over the “Fell Council of Liches” in the south where you lord over them using Ky’lo’s name as a weapon. You will stop at nothing and will kill all who stand your way. You have commanded your charges to bring forth the thieves so that they may pay for what they have done. 



You know that Nevaeh (Leah) has stolen the sword from the keep. You will be trying to capture her then you will involve her in a ritual to bring Ky’lo back in contact with the mortal realm. You know that the ritual with cause terrible damage to her spirit but that does not concern you.



 

**Tough Boss**: You’ve got a core of solid steel. Never accept a failure, never tolerate dissent, never tolerate fear of anything except your wrath.

Mystery of the Bottle 

**Written by:** Michael Fife           **Reviewed by:** 




 **Brief**: Adventurer’s have a choice to drink the liquid from a mysterious blue bottle.




 **Pre-requisites:** A player must drink from the bottle

**Background:** A bottle has mysteriously appeared in the tavern with a very ominous sign attached to it “Do **NOT** Drink.” This bottle is magical in nature and seems to radiate magic. Though if someone would drink this, what would happen?

**Synopsis**: A blue bottle is filled with a liquid and is stuck on the counter within the tavern. Once someone takes a drink of this mysterious liquid, they will fall to the ground. Out of game, they will head to the mod shack and be blindfolded and lead to an area. Once they arrive, the player will lay down once more and un-blindfolded. They will be within the plane of air, and before them will be a Silver Cube. The area seems to be a calm point within in the stormy plane and the cube seems to be what might bring the player back to the Prime Material Plane. When the player picks up the cube, they will be taken to the front of the Tavern and will Rift in holding the cube. Ten minutes after, an elemental lord of Stone will appear and speak with the player who has the cube. He will talk about the war with the plane of Air and how the cube is an Earth Artifact that was stolen and wishes to take it back to his plane of existence. After the elemental leaves, another ten minutes will pass and the players will be attacked by Air elementals and an Air Knight, demanding the cube back. If the players gave the cube back to the Earth elemental, the Air elementals will attack the players.

 

**Outcomes**:   (1) No one drinks from the bottle (2) Player will drink from the bottle but not take the cube, rifting them back to the Prime Material Plane after so many minutes (3) Players take the cube and return, setting off the motion of events. 






**
**

**Hook**: Blue Bottle in Tavern

**Page**: N/A

**Number of Cast Members**: 4

**Roles**: 1 Earth elemental(Sand), 4 Air Elementals (Maelstrom, 2 Lesser Air Elementals)

**Props**: Blue Bottle and Silver Cube

**Tags and Treasure**: Silver Cube (Does nothing when held by mortals. If held by someone Transformed 1xday Imprison 10xday Stone Bolt)

**Scene 1**: (OOG) Tavern

**Scene 2:** Plane of Air (walking hold)

**Scene 3:** Tyrra with or without cube

**Flee Point**: None (no combat)

 

**Non-Standard Effects**: N/A

**Rules Clarifications**: Planar Immunities/abilities

**Craftsman Information**: 

**Transformations**: Anyone with a transform will have their transform go up.

 




 **Running Notes**: This is to set up elemental plot that is more or less behind the scenes. Most players don’t think there is anything going on within the planes of power simply because they are not there, but this will let them know that there is indeed something going on and it seems it will spill out upon their plane of existence. Mod will either take place within one of the clearings off of one of the two trails, within the back of the NPC shack, in Mod shack, either way the player who drank from the bottle must be blindfolded and guided by someone since there is a possibility for real danger. 
 If someone has a transform and it goes up, they can Rift out with or without the cube if they have the ability. If they do not want to take the cube, they can just stand around for 10 minutes and will go back to where they were when drinking the liquid.





 

 

Mystery of the Bottle : Sand - Earth Elemental Lord

**Description:** One of many Elemental Lords. Though most seem to be solitary and stubborn, Sand is a sly and cunning elemental. He wishes to win the war for his plane and will trick the players in doing something they are NOT supposed to do. It was he who put the bottle in the Tavern to trick the players in taking the cube to further his own purposes.



**Cunning:**  Unlike most of the earth elementals, you wish to do something different. You will manipulate those that you can use like a weapon.

**Selfish:** You think only of yourself

**Greedy:** You need that cube!
 **Deflecting:** When asked about the war or what the cube is for, you will change the subject to something else, or decline outright to “protect the people”

Mystery of the Bottle : Maelstrom Air Elemental Lord

**Anger:** Just like the plane of air, you have a rage about you that cannot seem to be quelled

**Bringing Balance**

 

**Written by:** Michael Fife          **Reviewed by:** 




 **Brief**: Adair takes adventurers deep in the woods to find a large Order node. They must fight through the Lizard men guards and the elemental they summoned to bring it down.




 **Pre-requisites:** Ran after the “Forest Protector” mod

**Background:** The node that has been discovered is what is giving Mhairshulk strength within the land. Adair will tell the players that turning the node into chaos from order will start changing the land back to normal. 

**Synopsis**: Adair spoke to the adventurers earlier about the problems with one plane of existence taking over in the Prime material plane. He brings the adventurers to an Order node that seems to be larger than most and is growing stronger by the day, giving power to the Order following Lizard man army. Adair will lead them to a path towards the node, which is guarded heavily by lizard men. Fighting their way towards the node, they will be confronted by and Order elemental. Upon reaching him, he will accuse the players of being agents of chaos since they are in the presence of a chaos caster and attack them, no matter if they try to talk to him or not. After apologizing to the players, Adair will cast chaos magic into the Order node to revert it into a chaos node, after which he will tell them to expect him later in the day.

 

**Outcomes**: (1) Players will fight through and take down the Order node, helping to restore nature. (2)Players will fight the lizard guards and the Order elemental, but not allow Adair to cast the chaos magic (3) Players will be overcome by the fighting and have to flee.

With my hands tied, I must seek assistance from the outside!*

If any of the “heroes” show up that is on the list, they are to be brought through immediately without question.

 

Those who are going through will be checked out one at a time. They will have to form a line and wait their turn to go through into the border as the guards do their duties and check everyone.

 



**Checkpoint: Liboq the Strong**

 

*These creatures wish to come into our land?! Pitiful! Mhairshulk said to let the hairless apes through so I must do what he commands. These bastards better not try anything funny or they’ll have to answer to ME!
*




 **Notes:** 

·    Liboq is an angry individual. He was most likely sent to this part of the border due to his slippery hold on his anger. 

·    He has a short temper and a mean gaze. 

·    He makes up ridiculous accusations to get those he doesn’t like in trouble, and sometimes gets away with it. 

·    He is easily bribed to look the other way.

·

 **Treasure:** Silver

**

**Card:** 15th level fighter: 34 Body, Armor as worn, weapon style: any. Proficiency (hand specific)+8, 3x Critical Slay/Parry 



 

**Checkpoint: Litep the Fair**

*My brother isn’t the most sound of mind, but at least I can keep him under wraps. These people are blind and don’t know about the glory of Mhairshulk and his fairness. They come in here blindly barking out orders and waving their weapons at us when they don’t realize that we have given these people a good life.
*




 **Notes:** 

·    Litep is the brother of Liboq, he is also a very calm individual. 

·    He always keeps his brother in check, and if need be will defend him. 

·    Litep follows all rules and regulations that have been set forth, but he will be easy on someone who is caught with contraband. 

·    He cannot be bribed, no matter the sum.

**Checkpoint: Tlaxgar the Wise**

*I don’t know why I have to babysit these simpletons, but I know that these two can’t hold off all these outsiders! I must watch them for the spymaster Tenqzlat to see that none of the criminals that he is looking for crosses the borders!
*



**Notes:** 

·    Tlaxgar doesn’t want to be at the checkpoint, mostly due to the fact that he was a last minute addition to the list of the Border Patrol. 

·    Tlaxgar keeps to himself and doesn’t talk much, nor does he interact with the others. All he does is cast the Circle of Magic spell and takes notes. 

·    If he is killed at all, the notes will be about the two lizard men he is observing and all the people who came through, as well as rough drafts for reports to Tenqzlat.

The Smith’s Dilemma

**Written by:** Michael Fife **Reviewed by:** 




 **Brief**: Adventurers investigate a mine infested with spiders and are possibly betrayed by a miner. 




 **Requirements:** None

**Background:** The mine has been pushing out lots of ore for the town of Ollios and has since stopped production. With the effort to fight against the Lizard men, the town of Ollios has the convenience of a close mine owned by the region’s Smithing Guild. 

**Synopsis**: Dorin Steelsmasher is head of the town’s Smithing guild and is always on a schedule. When his shipment is late, his impatient nature shows and he tries to push the adventures and offers a substantial reward and recognition within the guild for helping. The players will get into the cave and fight their way down. They will find one of the miners inside, and if pressed they will find out he is a traitor who planted a magical device to stir the spiders into a frenzy. In the spider’s nesting area, they will find the magic device and bring it back to town for analysis. They will move through the building four times. The first three times will be the mine itself, the third being where the players will meet the suspicious miner. The fourth will be where the spider nest is located, the origin point of the infestation, and they will see the device after killing the spiders. 

**Outcomes**: (1) The Players go into the cave and kill all the spiders in the nest and return the mine to the miners (2) The Players are pushed back and the mine is taken over by the spiders, which then causes the surrounding area to be infested. Production for the town’s weapons and armor will slow down.






**
**

**Hook**: The head of the Smith’s Guild, Dorin Steelsmasher, will approach the Adventurers in the tavern.

**Page**: No

**Number of Cast Members**: 4-6

**Roles**: Dorin Steelsmasher (1), Miner Spy (1), Giant Phase Spiders (4) 

**Props**: A two handed hammer rep, circular stone Aztec slab for Magical device.

**Tags and Treasure**: Components, silver, Lizard-man Artifact. 

**Scene 1**: Mine entrance (monsters reset every minute from the entrance to the lower mine)

**Scene 2:** Second level of mine (monsters reset every 30 seconds from the entrance to the lower mine)

**Scene 3:** Third level of mine, spider webbing and eggs. Players meet Miner. (Monsters reset every 30 seconds)

**Scene 4:** Spider Nest, more eggs and the Magical Device. (monsters reset immediately twice)

**Flee Point**: (OOG) The door to the room. (IG) Mine Entrance that will lead back to town

**Non-Standard Effects**: None

**Rules Clarifications**: Physical Web

**Craftsman Information**: anyone with Craftsman Other Tracking (at least 2 ranks) will know there are no Phase Spiders within the area.

**Transformations**: None

 




 **Running Notes**: The person playing Dorin could possibly double as a spider if there aren’t many NPCs. There will be three scenes, the hook at the tavern, walking hold to where the mod will be used, and lastly at the mine. The mine should be at a building that has a front and back door; the players will fight through waves of spiders as they make their way down the mine. A sign for the Mine entrance should be made, as well as a roughly made map for the location of the mine.



**The Smith’s Dilemma:: Dorin Steelsmasher**

 *You called upon all the blacksmiths in Ollios, and have helped make this branch of the Smithing Guild one of the most efficiently ran. Now that the Lizard men have attacked, you are always worried about your schedule and them possibly ruining it. When you knew your shipments where coming in on time, you had to take drastic measures and call upon Adventurer’s to help you.*



**Notes:** The Character is gruff and to the point. He will become upset if the Adventurers do not listen to him or are taking their time when they agree to head to the mine. He will offer up what rewards he can to the adventurers, even paying them up-front if pushed. He will act desperate if none seem too eager.



**
 Treasure**: Gold to pay adventurers if they need money to be persuaded in helping him


**
**

**Card**: Dwarf Fighter (5th Level): 14 body, armor as worn, any weapon style, Proficiency (hand specific) +3



**The Smith’s Dilemma:: Jonas McRoy, Traitor**

*You needed to provide for your family and you where to much of a coward to join the army so you took the next best thing. You spent most of your life underground that you haven’t seen much of anything. When approached by the lizards, you wanted the money they gave to help your family, or you knew they would kill them if you refused. When you opened up that tunnel into the nest, you had to plant that magic device or pay day wouldn’t come. As soon as you put the device near the rest spiders and they started going berserk, your cowardice showed and it was every man for them self.* 



**Notes:** Jonas will be cocooned by the spiders and will talk to the players when questioned. 
 When asked about the wall

“The wall collapsed on itself, I don’t know how”

When asked about the hammer on the floor.

“I don’t know where that hammer came from, why are you asking me?”

When asked why he stayed when the Miners fled.
 “ Listen, I didn’t get out because I was taking a nap, I was tired, alright!?”

If pushed further

“Listen, the Lizard-men set me up. They gave me money to get those spiders to attack, I don’t know why, but they might kill my family!”



**Treasure**: None


**
**

**Card**: Human Rogue 2nd level: 5 body, armor as worn, 1 handed edge, Florentine, two weapons. Backstab+2



**The Smith’s Dilemma:: Spiders**

*Darkness, that’s all you needed in life, that and food. The noises came closer and closer throughout the years, and when they got louder, it disrupted the slumber. Now the hairless creatures invaded your home, and they look oh so delicious.* 



**Phase Spiders:** Was once normal giant spiders, but now changed to phase spiders due to the magical effects of the Lizard-man artifact. 



**Treasure**: Components, gold, silver, and Lizard man artifact will be in room, not on spiders.


**
**

**Card**: Giant Phase Spiders: 30 body, Small Weapon - 4 Normal, Short/Longsword - 5 Normal, Physical Web x 3, Immune to Pin/Bind/Web

**Notes:** Revert back to normal Spiders when Magic Item taken out of mine



The Forest Protector



**Written by:** Michael Fife    **Reviewed by:** 



**Brief**: Players speak with a druid and are told about the atrocities of the lizardmen.



**Requirements:** This is to run while the Checkpoint! Mod is being run; only six PCs are to go on this

**Background:** With the rise of lizard men coming into the area, there has been a change in balance around Oilios. With Order on the rise, the other powers are waning. Adair, a Druid charged with protecting the balance of nature around Oilios, has noticed that with the lizard men moving into the area, that the plane of Order has been offsetting the balance. Noticing that the army of lizards is too much for one person, he must enlist in the help of the locals.

**Synopsis**: A white wolf will approach the tavern with a note. The note will detail that they must meet this druid immediately, and only a select few must come. They will travel deep within the forest to meet with the druid, where he will let the adventurers know that they are to push back the lizard men and stop the rise of Order from becoming too strong. He will also let the adventurers know about the corruption and theft of animals from the forest, letting them know that the lizard men are doing something to them.

**Outcomes**: 1) The Players do not follow the instructions and choose not to go 2) Players kill the wolf and go to the druid, being told nothing if the wolf is killed. 3) The players go to the druid.



**
**

**Hook**: A white wolf carrying a note.

**Page**: No 

**Number of Cast Members**: 3

**Roles**: Adair the Druid, white wolf, dire bear

**Props**: Campfire (if weather permits), walking stick

**Tags and Treasure**: Components

**Scene**: A forest clearing where the Druid makes his home. 

**Flee Point**: trail leading back to town

**Non-Standard Effects**: None

**Rules Clarifications**: Damage reductions for dire creatures (bear/wolf)

**Craftsman Information**: Anyone with craftsman other in tracking will determine how deep in the forest they are.

**Transformations**: None 

 



**Running Notes**: 

Campfire: Use a campfire for this module if the weather is not terrible. We will not do the fire if there is a downpour, but will do it if it is drizzling or just wet after a rain. There is to be no fighting at all near the fire! We will need someone to watch over it (the person playing the druid) while it is lit, and there should be a bucket filled with water ready to douse it when the module is over. 



**The Forest Protector: Adair

**

*You have been charged with watching over this part of the land for what seems like centuries. The elders have proclaimed that the balance must be kept! The lizard men seemed to have kept that until more moved in. With the erection of the obelisks, they have made Order nodes to strengthen themselves and the plane of Order. With my hands tied, I must seek assistance from the outside!*

 

**Notes:** 

**Solemn and Quiet:** You are solemn and quiet showing great calm and confidence. 

**You need help**: The army of lizard men is too much for one person, he must enlist in the help of the locals.

**Focused on balance**: You wish to see the balance of nature returned. Noticing that with too much Order coming into the land, the chaos of nature will weaken the spirits and sicken the lands. He will talk to the nobles that they must push back and possibly instill some chaos nodes where the lizard men started making Order nodes. 


 **Information you know:**

1. There is a lizardman camp deeper in the woods that is heavily guarded. (**Natural Cleansing**)
2. The lizard men are hunting down animals and corrupting them, trying to spread a new breed of mutated animals about the forest. (**Unnatural Beings**)
3. The locations of Order Nodes. (**Bringing Balance**)



**Treasure:** Components (to give to the players for good faith) Cantrip Tome (earth)

**

**Card:** 20th lvl Earth Scholar(Played by Michael Fife: 16 Body, Armor as worn. 1handed edge, Read&Write, First Aid,Healing Arts. Pyramid: 6,6,6,/6,6,6/6,6,6



**The Forest Protector: Dire Bear (Boris)**

*Master said to stay close so the others don’t get any ideas. I must obey the master; he helped me with that deer and feeds me yummy stuff. I love the master.
\* 
 **Notes:**  The dire bear is more or less Adair’s pet. Fierce and mighty, he will stand close to his master and fight alongside him.
 **Treasure:** Gold

**Dire Bear** 

**Card:**  Dire Bear: 100 body, Small Claws-9 normal, Short/Longsword claws- 10 normal. Half damage from weapons, Rips from Pin/Bind/Web/Confine 



Hound of tindalos Visions



At the start of the event the players are given a small card with a vision on it. The players will then roleplay seeing this vision if they are hit with a Hallucinate gas from the Hounds of Tindalos. 



You FEEL a sense of panic and desperation at your fraud being found out

You FEEL the rush of a big score from a gamble gone totally right.

You FEEL a sense of relief from having pinned a crime on someone else.

You FEEL an overwhelming sense of unease at the prospect of imprisonment.

You FEEL a hunger and a need for release.

You FEEL a sense of unease and a need to hurry.

You FEEL a sense of shame because of your failed mission.

You FEEL that this is the best time of your life you are awesome and you are famous and you are powerful.

You SEE everyone's eyes as pearls which glimmer with ill intent.

You SEE a fat banker dripping with sweat. He motions to you to follow him. As you follow him he darts away leading you further and further from your friends.

You SEE the lilacs out of the dead land littering the grass.

You SEE the general of the seven armies kneeling before you begging for mercy. He is begging to be spared the mark of the chained one.

You SEE an evil statue with an odd smoke coming from it. The statue grows larger filling the whole of your vision.

You HEAR a conversation- "My nerves are bad tonight" "It's Ok nobody saw us come here" "What is that noise" then nothing.

You HEAR chains rattling and a low sobbing.

You HEAR a scream nearby quickly followed by a stern voice whispering.

You HEAR the screams of the captives who refused to bear the mark. 

You REMEMBER hiding under the shadow of a red rock hoping that the hounds would leave.

You REMEMBER a green cloaked man dealing out cards and picking up chips.

You REMEMBER eyes made of pearls that held no mercy.

You REMEMBER telling the banker that he will need to pay the price soon.

You REMEMBER looking to your left and saying "Hold on tight the storm is coming." Of course this was a lie, the storm was already here.



NERO ELKINS July 20 2012 Visions



You REMEMBER being shocked when reading your horoscope.

You REMEMBER the river being filled with the bodies of those who tried to cross the great bridge. 

You REMEMBER a woman sitting in a chair which shines like a burnished throne with small smile on her lips.

You REMEMBER sitting on a cliff face studying a map.

You REMEMBER crouching on the field of battle. Blood is dripping from your sword and the bodies of your friends litter the field. You then say to yourself “There is no helping them it is time to move on.”

You REMEMBER scribing a mark into the skin of the banker. You ignore his terrified screams.

You REMEBER watching a thin woman in loose fitting clothes whicle she poisons a drink.

You REMEMBER being found out by the wrong people now you will be marked as well.

You TASTE the sweetness of blood in your mouth. That fool should know better than to cross you.

You SMELL the stench of fog. They are coming and there is no escape.
