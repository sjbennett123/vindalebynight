The Forest Protector

**Written by:** Michael Fife    **Reviewed by:** 

**Brief**: Players speak with a druid and are told about the atrocities of the lizardmen.

**Requirements:** This is to run while the Checkpoint! Mod is being run; only six PCs are to go on this

**Background:** With the rise of lizard men coming into the area, there has been a change in balance around Oilios. With Order on the rise, the other powers are waning. Adair, a Druid charged with protecting the balance of nature around Oilios, has noticed that with the lizard men moving into the area, that the plane of Order has been offsetting the balance. Noticing that the army of lizards is too much for one person, he must enlist in the help of the locals.

**Synopsis**: A white wolf will approach the tavern with a note. The note will detail that they must meet this druid immediately, and only a select few must come. They will travel deep within the forest to meet with the druid, where he will let the adventurers know that they are to push back the lizard men and stop the rise of Order from becoming too strong. He will also let the adventurers know about the corruption and theft of animals from the forest, letting them know that the lizard men are doing something to them.

**Outcomes**: 1) The Players do not follow the instructions and choose not to go 2) Players kill the wolf and go to the druid, being told nothing if the wolf is killed. 3) The players go to the druid.

**Hook**: A white wolf carrying a note.

**Running Notes**: 

Campfire: Use a campfire for this module if the weather is not terrible. We will not do the fire if there is a downpour, but will do it if it is drizzling or just wet after a rain. There is to be no fighting at all near the fire! We will need someone to watch over it (the person playing the druid) while it is lit, and there should be a bucket filled with water ready to douse it when the module is over. 



**The Forest Protector: Adair
 
**

*You have been charged with watching over this part of the land for what seems like centuries. The elders have proclaimed that the balance must be kept! The lizard men seemed to have kept that until more moved in. With the erection of the obelisks, they have made Order nodes to strengthen themselves and the plane of Order. With my hands tied, I must seek assistance from the outside!*

 

**Notes:** 

**Solemn and Quiet:** You are solemn and quiet showing great calm and confidence. 

**You need help**: The army of lizard men is too much for one person, he must enlist in the help of the locals.

**Focused on balance**: You wish to see the balance of nature returned. Noticing that with too much Order coming into the land, the chaos of nature will weaken the spirits and sicken the lands. He will talk to the nobles that they must push back and possibly instill some chaos nodes where the lizard men started making Order nodes.
