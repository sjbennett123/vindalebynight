Slick tries to be a Knight

**Written by:** Kevin Logue
 **Reviewed by:** 

 **Brief**: Slick the lizard man knight enters town and follows up on dealings from the message boards.
 **Background**: 
 **Synopsis**: Slick was one of the lizard men who entered the town and helped make the deal for Ollios to be a part of the Lizard Empire for the help of the lizard people to stand before the undead army coming. The lizards feel that they have entered into a deal with Dalantia, who has signed the Accords. There for the Lizards feel they are now a member nation of the Accords. Slick has been appointed a Knight in the city of Ollios. 

 

He will travel to the next gather to speak with many of the players and hear their concerns about some of the issues his lords and ladies have been causing on the In Game forums. Also he charged Nikkoli with Mockery of a Noble Title and will try to see justice done.




 **Hook**: None

**Page**: No

**Number of Cast Members**: 2-3

**Roles**: Slick, Isstan the Squire, Lady Varae (if Kristin is there)

**Props**: Lizard man costumes

**Tags and Treasure**: Long swords, shields, gas packets, writ stateing Slicks title and Isstan. Also a writ stateing that Slick is to investigate the mockery of a noble title as cleared by whoever.

**Scene 1**: N/A

**Scene 1 Flee**: Open Space

**Non-Standard Effects**: Magical abilities delivered via gas call.

**Rules Clarifications**: Any effect done by the lizards can be blocked by a poison shield or shield magic if any of their attacks use a spell. Any magic delivered by the poison call can be cured by a purify blood spell or dispel magic. Or a standard fix to the status ailment. 


 **Running Notes**: The people in town are going to be upset from what is going on. They are going to have a slew of questions Slick can not answer and does not know. This is going to test the waters to see if the players want to investigate if all the lizards are evil or if some are good, or if their just going to execute all the lizards they see. My hope is to get some role play going and to let the PC’s decide how they want to approach the lizard problem.

Slick tries to be a Knight**: Isstan Colden Lizard Man Squire**

It is lonely growing up alone. In the collective of the lizard folk there is not really an opportunity to individualize one’s self. But you want more, you want to be a trail blazer, you want your people to have room to grow and be happy. You were under the basic education of a mage when Slick picked you to be his squire. Your ability to listen to folks and identify the best path to follow under the law made you a great candidate. You hope to be a Knight one day, to serve with Slick and to enforce the laws of the Accords of Avalon and the laws of the Lizard Folk.

##### Slick Tries to be a Knight: Lady Varae the Quetzelcotle

*Lady of the Lizard people. Works to expand her empire and her people’s living space. Is an astute follower of law and order. But will do everything within the structure of that order to bend the playing field to her way. She is smart, knows how to identify weaknesses in people and will exploit them without hesitancy if it brings the lizard people strength in any way. He people worship her, she is a living god among them and she will take care of them. Somehow she got lumped in with the politics plaguing the lizard people and is looking for safety for those that would still follow her among the chaos that is rising from the order.*
