Lizard Patrol finds a Tax Evader**: Plasst – Lizardman Guard**

The voice is right, the lizards are the rightful rulers of this chaos filled land. These pink skinned hooch guzzling mongrals are going to destroy the land itself and the order of everything! This stupid fat merchant could not have paid his taxes, he is stuttering all over the place and your going to get to the bottom of this. You know he is guilty… none of these pink skins are truly good, you will claw the truth out of this oaf if it takes all the rage you can muster. 



**Bad Cop** : The lizardmen almost totalitarian in their respect for the law. They will grill the merchant asking leading questions till he cracks. 

·    Where is your paperwork?

·    Where are you coming from?

·    Who did you get the goods from?

·    Who did they get the goods from?

·    Why was he trying to hide some of your goods?

·    Why don’t you want to pay your taxes?

·    Are there illegal substances in there that you wanted to hide?

·    Do you like chaos, what does you think of necromancy?

·    If a small girl and boy are both about to fall off a cliff who would you save?

## Lizard Patrol finds a Tax Evader: Ssent – Lizardman Guard

*Your just trying to get by, do your job. You have only been with the guard since the lizards came to the surface last year and patrole regularly when they let you, better to stretch your legs then sit on that darn wall. You love being paird with Plasst because he always gets fired up about everything. Its more amusing then your second uncle hitting on the girls back at the pub. You’re not sure if this merchant is doing anything wrong, but why interfere with Plasst, you know he will make a decision and you will just support him and follow action. Whatever to pass the time until this guard duty is over.*

##### Lizard Patrol finds a Tax Evader: Marien the Merchant

*Good grief! Lizards! Ahhhh! Why in the world are they grilling you, what did you do? You made sure to pay your taxes, you showed all your papers when you came over the border, but when this patrole started rooting through your stuff and yelling… well you just about lost it, how the heck can you remember what the taxs lizards checked with these idiots yelling at you like you just robbed a stage coach? Oh Tyrra why… why are they yelling, make it stop! Where is your purse, can you just pay them off? Oh thank the elements, adventurers! Maybe they will settle this, please oh please do not let them think your breaking the law damnit!*



The merchant is beside himself, he doesn’t know what to do, he wants to get out of this situtation but doesn’t want to pay double the taxes.
