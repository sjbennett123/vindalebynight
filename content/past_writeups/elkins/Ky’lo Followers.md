**Synopsis**: You are the voice of Ky’lo, or so you think. You go town to town, doing the bidding of Ky’lo. Being that Ky’lo is trapped on the plane of Death, you have stopped caring for your well being and in order to be as close to death as possible.

Notes: These will come out during the first night and will come out as role-playing encounters during Saturday at different intervals between modules. They will follow Nevaeh (Leah) and be as close to her as possible (invading personal space). Keep telling her different phrases to try and creep her out (written below). After five minutes, whoever is playing this card will scream as loud as they can and fall over dead.
