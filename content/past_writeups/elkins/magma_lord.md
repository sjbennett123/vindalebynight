Checkers with the Magma Lord **:: Macklin the **







**Reason for Living**: The life of a magma lord is spent waiting for a certain activity. The magma lord only removes himself from stasis to participate in this activity.

**Stasis**: A magma lord can enter into stasis which is very similar to the effects of the Imprison spell but with 4 distinctions. (1)A Magma Lord can only enter stasis while on the plane of fire. (2)Stasis is immune to the Dispel Magic spell. (3) Stasis only be cast on self. (4)Stasis has an unlimited duration

**Near Death:** If a Magma Lord enters battle it will die at the end of it. It cannot exert itself and survive.

**Planar Mind:** Invite the players to talk amongst themselves to make the best play against him. Explain that you can communicate with all of the elementals on the plane of fire.

**Levelheaded**: Unlike most fire elementals you have control of your temper and are simply interested in playing your game. If someone takes the artifacts from the table without having bested you in the contest you will slaughter them and all of their people it is the way of things. 

**A florish with every move :** Before moving your checkers make a flourish with your robe.
