Lizard Patrol finds a Necromancer

**Written by:** Kevin Logue **Reviewed by:** 

 **Brief**: A patrol of lizard folk have captured a necromancer and are trying to administer justice.

 **Synopsis**: The adventurers come across a patrole of lizard folk with a man in custody. The man is guilty of necromancy. Next to the trio is a destroyed skeleton, one of the lizards is tainted and the man himself is tainted, when he tried to taint both the lizard guards after they killed his skeleton, he got one but the other had a reflect magic. The lizards are debating whether to carry out the sentence for necromancy and assult then and there or whether they should take the man back for a proper judge to carry out the sentence. But they do not know what the punishment is for necromancy or assult, they are just simple guardsmen, they know the laws but not how to enforce them. By right they may carry out low justice but not high justice. The debate is whether or not the crimes are deserving of high justice or not.

**Thossen – Guard 2**

Thossen wants to follow the law, but is a bit over zealous. He firmly believes anyone breaking the law should be held to the highest standard of punishment. Necromancy is the complete sign of not following the law! I mean come on now! That dirty necromancer tried to taint your blood, that is assult on the city guard. Assult on you! If you can you will show that necromancer to the earth circle for his transgressions.

**Sissil – Guard 1**

*Sissil is a bit slow, he is a good lizard, he knows the laws well enough to watch for folks breaking them and knows one end of a weapon from the other. But he is not always sure if the person he is about to grab is in the wrong, or what he is capable of doing about it. You know that this guy cast necromancy, you know that your buddy is magically effected so that he can not harm the perpetrator. You always take criminals back for judgement but Thossen is pushing for you to pass judgement now.*

##### Karter – The necromancer

*You were just passing through Dalantia. You know that in the past necromancers have been over looked… frowned on but over looked. You had a skeleton summoned for a favor you did near the border of the kingdom and it was acting as your body guard till you ran into these freaking lizards. You know their bad news for anyone… their crazy and they hate chaos and they are going to hurt you if they take you… a lot. You tried to waylay them but had your own spell back fire on you. You tainted your own blood! Now what? Oh Tyrra if you could just run the heck away… but wait there are adventurers coming. The gypsi’s in the area won’t let them kill you! Yea yea, now to talk your way out of this with that silver tongue of yours. Time to get to work.*
