Hound of tindalos Visions



At the start of the event the players are given a small card with a vision on it. The players will then roleplay seeing this vision if they are hit with a Hallucinate gas from the Hounds of Tindalos. 



You FEEL a sense of panic and desperation at your fraud being found out

You FEEL the rush of a big score from a gamble gone totally right.

You FEEL a sense of relief from having pinned a crime on someone else.

You FEEL an overwhelming sense of unease at the prospect of imprisonment.

You FEEL a hunger and a need for release.

You FEEL a sense of unease and a need to hurry.

You FEEL a sense of shame because of your failed mission.

You FEEL that this is the best time of your life you are awesome and you are famous and you are powerful.

You SEE everyone's eyes as pearls which glimmer with ill intent.

You SEE a fat banker dripping with sweat. He motions to you to follow him. As you follow him he darts away leading you further and further from your friends.

You SEE the lilacs out of the dead land littering the grass.

You SEE the general of the seven armies kneeling before you begging for mercy. He is begging to be spared the mark of the chained one.

You SEE an evil statue with an odd smoke coming from it. The statue grows larger filling the whole of your vision.

You HEAR a conversation- "My nerves are bad tonight" "It's Ok nobody saw us come here" "What is that noise" then nothing.

You HEAR chains rattling and a low sobbing.

You HEAR a scream nearby quickly followed by a stern voice whispering.

You HEAR the screams of the captives who refused to bear the mark. 

You REMEMBER hiding under the shadow of a red rock hoping that the hounds would leave.

You REMEMBER a green cloaked man dealing out cards and picking up chips.

You REMEMBER eyes made of pearls that held no mercy.

You REMEMBER telling the banker that he will need to pay the price soon.

You REMEMBER looking to your left and saying "Hold on tight the storm is coming." Of course this was a lie, the storm was already here.



NERO ELKINS July 20 2012 Visions



You REMEMBER being shocked when reading your horoscope.

You REMEMBER the river being filled with the bodies of those who tried to cross the great bridge. 

You REMEMBER a woman sitting in a chair which shines like a burnished throne with small smile on her lips.

You REMEMBER sitting on a cliff face studying a map.

You REMEMBER crouching on the field of battle. Blood is dripping from your sword and the bodies of your friends litter the field. You then say to yourself “There is no helping them it is time to move on.”

You REMEMBER scribing a mark into the skin of the banker. You ignore his terrified screams.

You REMEBER watching a thin woman in loose fitting clothes whicle she poisons a drink.

You REMEMBER being found out by the wrong people now you will be marked as well.

You TASTE the sweetness of blood in your mouth. That fool should know better than to cross you.

You SMELL the stench of fog. They are coming and there is no escape.
