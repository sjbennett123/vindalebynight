 You are going to talk to those who have taken your 



Give the players the waystone that will allow them to travel to the plane of fire in order to match wits with the fire elemental. You are not certain about what exactly ‘ mach wits’ means but you know that some muscle will be required. 



**Waystone:** Give the large stone to the players. Tell them that to travel to the plane of fire they will need to fill the hole in the center with water and each traveler will need to say in unison “To the fire plane we go” to return they will need to place the fingers in the hole and say “to tyrra we go”

**High Pressure Sale:** You need this job to be done and are willing to be fairly pushy about it. You are willing to offer them a magic item of their choice in exchange for the frabjis which you will destroy.

**They Will have your Scent:** Once one has ventured to the plane of fire to match wits with the magma lord the guardians have the scent of him and will target him if he returns.

**Zachery the Scarred – Servant of Ludavico**



You are a servant of Ludavico the Chained one. One of the first tasks you were given was to go to the plane of fire and best the magma lord in some contest. When the magma lord was beaten you would be given permission to take one of his treasures and were to take the Frabjus a multi-part sculpture. 

You went there alone confident in the powers that you had been given by Ludavico. 

When you arrived you were overwhelmed by the onslaught of fire elementals that appeared in the chamber. Before they released you they charred your face and ensured that you would never heal as you were before your visit to the plane of fire.
