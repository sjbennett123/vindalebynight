The Formian Pet
Written by: Scott Bennett Reviewed by: Kathryn Rose
________________________________________
Brief: Adventurers encounter a group of Formians Warriors who attempt to negotiate by telepathically speaking through a captured human.
________________________________________
Requirements: None
Background: The Formian colony has expanded and is intruding upon the adventurers’ lands. The Formians have tired of constantly being defeated by adventurers. To avoid more conflict they have captured an unsuspecting townsperson, Marcus Henke, and began feeding him a paste that will allow them to telepathically speak through him.
Synopsis: The Formians have been waiting for their opportunity to speak to the adventurers and attempt diplomacy for months. Using their hive mind the Formians are going to use Marcus as a mouthpiece to speak to the adventurers and offer them a variety of "Formian Treasures". If the adventurers leave the caves without battle the hive will know that the adventurers can be bought and will always offer whatever “treasure” the players have accepted in their future dealings. If negotiations erupt in violence the Formians will fight to the death to protect their "Pet".
Outcomes: (1) The Formain attempt at negotiation fails and there is a mass of combat. (2) The adventurers reach an agreement with the Formians and set the tone for the future.

Running Notes: The Formians are a tough combat challenge. Scale them up to the “greater formain” role if they will be too weak or if you have far fewer cast members than PC’s on the encounter. You can replace the Ogre with any other costumed NPC that you have around the NPC shack. The essence of the encounter is capturing the alien nature of the Formians by showing how they negotiate. 
This can also be ran as a link between other encounters because of how little setup/tear down that is required.
 
The Formain Pet:: Formian Warrior
Your life has been spent in the darkness of the hive. It consists of the same routine digging of new tunnels, and fighting off intruders to the marvelous underhive. All of this is in the service to the great hive queen. Now the queen has demanded that the hive expand. This expansion has brought you into contact with the soft-skins of the above-world. These interactions are often violent and always costly to the hive. Possibly instead of fighting the soft skinned creatures it would be better to discuss the ceding of their land to the hive voluntarily with none of these costly battles.To this end you and your brothers have captured and cared for one of the soft skinned creatures to use as a mouthpiece. You have kept him alive by feeding him a steady diet of grub paste which has made him a member of the hive. Hopefully you will be able to convince any intruders that the hive is best left in peace. 
________________________________________
You will negotiate with the adventures and attempt to convince them to leave the hive in peace. If they agree to this then you will be able to solidify the hive’s hold on the area.  The pain that the Formain Telepathy causes is of no concern to the hive for the subject will continue to function.
________________________________________
Formain Telepathy: Feeding a human grub paste links them to the hive mind. Beings that are not of the same Insect-like physiology as Formians are subjected to indescribable pain whenever this link is used. Out of Game, the Formain Telepathy is represented by one of the Formain Warriors whispering into the human with a connection to the hive mind's ear and the Human will relay the message. Humans do not remember the words that they say when they are being controlled by the Formian Telepathy. 
Formian Treasures: The Formains attempt to give the adventurers some manner of ‘treasure’ to allow the hive to expand without incident. These items are actually worthless but are seen as valuable from the perspective of the Formians. Each Formain Warrior should choose an item from the Formian Treasures below or make one up keeping in mind that it needs to be odd and essentially worthless.

Formian Warrior
Silent Killers: Formian Warriors cannot speak due to their advanced hive mind. All of their communication with the surface races is through clacking mandibles and frantic gestures.  Formians do not understand human concepts such as mercy and friendship but they know that the soft skins do and will try to use these weaknesses against them for the glory of the hive.
Protect the Queen: A Formian warrior only lives to serve the hive and it’s queen.
Group Mind (NERO 9’th): Some types of creatures notably some giant insects have a group mind. Each creature’s mind is but part of a larger whole. What one of them sees or experiences, they all know; however, Holds cannot be called for the players to converse. Creatures that are part of a Group Mind are immune to mind control affects. An Awaken spell will not free them of the group mind’s  control. Mind controlling Effects for Group Mind are defined as: Shun, Calm, Sleep, Dominate, Enslavement, Charm, Fear and Vampire Charm.

The Formain Pet:: Marcus Henke the Prisioner
It seems like an eternity since these horrible creatures captured you. Weeks, months, years, who knows down here in the dark and with their clacking and their smell, oh Tyrra, that smell is like old socks. The worst part of this whole mess is that they only feed you this horrible white paste that tastes like almonds. The last several weeks you have been blacking out and waking up with the most terrible headache. You think you must be going mad down here in these caves. 
You want your life back. You want freedom on the surface again. When you see people again, you know that they will rescue you from these monsters.

The formains will be speaking through you to the adventures using the Formian Telepathy and offering them worthless treasures. Marcus wants to be freed but needs the adventurers help.

Humans that are being controlled by Formain Telepathy will have one accent for when the human is in control and a different one when the Formains are in control.

•	The encounter running well really hinges on your skill at improvisation and the switch between when you are controlled by the Formians and when you are free to speak as Marcus. 
•	Marcus does not know that the Formians are speaking through him so he is going to be surprised and need to figure out what the Formians are doing by talking to the adventurers.

The Formain Pet:: Ogre Corpse
It seemed like such a good idea to be exploring the darkness of the dungeon and then BOOM it was all over. The chittering and clacking of their inhuman bodies pouring out of the depths filled your ears. The insect like Formians quickly overwhelm you, your massive strength seeming to work against you as they stab you with their long terrible mandibles. The world went black.
