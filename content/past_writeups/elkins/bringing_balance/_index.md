title: Bringing Balance
author: Michael Fife
layout: module
description: Adair takes adventurers deep in the woods to find a large Order node. They must fight through the Lizard men guards and the elemental they summoned to bring it down.
Pre-requisites: 
 - Ran after the “Forest Protector” mod
Background: The node that has been discovered is what is giving Mhairshulk strength within the land. Adair will tell the players that turning the node into chaos from order will start changing the land back to normal. 
Synopsis: Adair spoke to the adventurers earlier about the problems with one plane of existence taking over in the Prime material plane. He brings the adventurers to an Order node that seems to be larger than most and is growing stronger by the day, giving power to the Order following Lizard man army. Adair will lead them to a path towards the node, which is guarded heavily by lizard men. Fighting their way towards the node, they will be confronted by and Order elemental. Upon reaching him, he will accuse the players of being agents of chaos since they are in the presence of a chaos caster and attack them, no matter if they try to talk to him or not. After apologizing to the players, Adair will cast chaos magic into the Order node to revert it into a chaos node, after which he will tell them to expect him later in the day.
Outcomes:
 - Players will fight through and take down the Order node, helping to restore nature.
 - Players will fight the lizard guards and the Order elemental, but not allow Adair to cast the chaos magic 
 - Players will be overcome by the fighting and have to flee.
