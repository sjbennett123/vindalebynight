Role: Adair (played by Michael Fife)



*I have been charged with watching over this part of the land for what seems like centuries. The elders have proclaimed that the balance must be kept! The lizard men seemed to have kept that until more moved in. With the erection of the obelisks, they have made Order nodes to strengthen themselves and the plane of Order. With my hands tied, I must seek assistance from the outside!*

**Description**:

·     Adair still shows off his calm demeanor during the whole module

·    He will speak with the players bluntly, but never show anger unless they deface nature (littering in his presence for example)

·    Before casting the chaos magic upon the Order node (Desecrate 2 times) He will tell them his plans, letting them know what he must do to “cleanse” the Order node.

·    If attacked, Adair will not fight back and try to calm the players down with talk. If none listen, he will flee.

·    Will only go with adventurers if they have no healer in party
