running_notes: This module is a brutal raid by the Bloody Fist on Vindale out of pure vengeance for their fallen brothers. The Vindale Vampires have been impaling heads on spikes for a long time, the Bloody Fist are just their latest victims. This is a very straight forward model, march and fight till dead.
