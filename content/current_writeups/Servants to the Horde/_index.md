Motivation: Shamans are the literal backbone of the Bloody Fist fighting machine. The Grunts take the abuse for you, and you heal their wounds, but you always make wounds that don’t heal so easily. You outrank the Raid Leaders in power structure, but you respect their battlefield skill and prowess so unless the command is unsound you will follow it even till death. You are one of 2 Shaman Casters in a Raiding Party. One is ALWAYS Celestial and the other Earth caster. You are 100% support for your squadron. Celestial will blow up the PCs while Earth casters keep everyone alive and disable with Chaos.

Tactics: Stay in formation with your Grunts in front of you and beside your Raid Leaders. You play these roles like a PC healer/necromancer/celestial caster would. The players will be confused at your intelligence and use of “sky magics” for a the “common Orc” so use that to your advantage. Kidnap when you can if the person is of value.

If you are the Earth caster of the pairing, KEEP YOUR MEN ALIVE! When everyone is safe on healing, disable them with Chaos debuffs and Cause Wound spells. Don’t waste Death Spells because you will need Life Spells for your Raid Leaders and other Use Necromancy to Harm/Taint Blood/Wither against your enemies, even raise dead on the ones who die during an encounter) to incite fear.
