description: Merchants sell components and other unusual wares. 
synopsis: Merchants come to town wearing the Belt-Flag of The Guilds of Rockshire if anyone notices (crossover plot). One merchant is selling Components and Production items, a second merchant is with him and has more unusual wears. If he can find potential buyers, the second Merchant will reveal he has a Transform to Alpha Pantherghast lvl 7 (acts as a Hunter Transform) scroll for sale as well as Enslavement Elixirs. These will be only revealed in private due to the nature of the content of his wares, he will invite them to step into his “cabin” away from town alone. If they are killed for their goods or for being “shady” they will both Transform to their Alpha Pantherghast against the race whomever killed them.
