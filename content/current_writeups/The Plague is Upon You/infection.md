title: Infection
---

Some creatures have the ability to infect helpless victims with material that will turn the person into a version of the creature. Unlike a werewolf or vampire curse, this is only a physical transformation of the victim’s body. Players will be told of specific triggers if necessary. Victims will lose all memory of their former lives, and the player must follow the commands they are given by the Monster Master until the character is slain. The character may then be killed and then given a Life spell and be cured of the infection. If the player dies the spirit may then proceed to the Healers’ Guild to be resurrected as normal. Infection is done just as a Killing Blow, with a count of “I infect you 1, I infect you 2, I infect you 3.”
