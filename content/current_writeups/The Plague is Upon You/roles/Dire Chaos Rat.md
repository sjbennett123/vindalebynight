Infection- is done just as a Killing Blow, with a count of “I infect you 1, I infect you 2, I infect you 3.” Then you will give a small card to whoever you infect with the directions. Directions- You are to try to get people to drink from the spring. You are no longer affected by the spring.
Devour- on a 3 count, recover 40 body if they feast on a freshly 'killed' enemy. This is not a killing blow effect and still be healed back up
