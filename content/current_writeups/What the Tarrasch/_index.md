description: As a lark, the Bishop and King send a marked Pawn to the tavern in Vindale for a drink.

synopsis: |
  Some poor soul in the (unknowing) employ of the Tarrasch is tasked with a rather simple burden, go get a drink in the tavern in Vindale. Thegreth Feseldu, the drinker, thinks it strange job, having to go from Stonewood to Vindale for a drink, but oh well. The pay was good, and Thegreth got a horse out of it. Thegreth will try to sell the adventurers the horse, as they cannot care for it.
  
  Thegreth will enter the tavern easily and in good spirits. They will get a drink, sit down, and talk. They are fun and easy to talk to, if a bit loud. Thegreth is not be worried about drawing eyes, in fact they love it! A quick wit and a wicked sense of humor come easy to Thegreth, and they show it proudly. If wanted, they can start a card game with those in the tavern. (The goal is to not hide the hand tattoo, and to draw attention to it and themselves.)
  
  If someone buys the horse, Thegreth will pull a horse out of a pocket and give it to them. But only then. Up until then, it's like he is talking about a real horse. 
  
  Information known by the drinker, Thegreth Feseldu, no other information is known about the Tarrasch except by plot direction- 
  
  You were a beggar in Stonewood. The city is still reeling from the adventurer invasion... er, "Market Day". Stonewood has been overran with these... bugs. No, the rats left after all the grain was gone. They have been hungry all summer. The economy is in a tailspin, and the harvest does not bring the promise of relief this year. This person doesn't really like the adventurers very much, and it shows. It is bad there, but they don't know a whole lot of specifics. It's just bad, ok?
  
  They were approached in Stonewood while starving in a gutter, and were told that they would be paid one silver a day to do errands given to them by a person. The person is different every time a job comes up, but the person always know who Thegreth is by name. The one who tattooed them was some random in Stonewood; they were given a drawing by the person who approached them in the gutter, and told to get it on their hand to start employment. They have never seen the person who told them this again. No, they don't remember what this person looked like.
  
  Thegreth was paid two gold to travel from Stonewood to Vindale, plus a horse and the price of a drink. They cannot afford the horse, and want to sell it, and will try to do so, even if being interrogated.
  
  They don't know much of the events in Stonewood on it's last Market Day. They were rather... indisposed. (When pressed, they say they were drunk all weekend)
  
  You are no longer a beggar because of your job.
  
  You have no idea you work for the Tarrasch. You don't know anything about a Litch or anything of the sort.
  
outcomes: 
  - The PCs confront Thegreth Feseldu, interrogate, or otherwise hold them.
  - The PCs miss the tattoo and Thegreth leaves unhindered.
