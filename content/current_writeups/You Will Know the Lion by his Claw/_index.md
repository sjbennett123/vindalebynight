description: A Forest Crypt is guarded by mysterious Marble Lion Statues. They seem to have been here for a long time at this point but pristine in upkeep. They belonged to the Lionheart of the pre-adventuring days of Vindale. Lord Lionheart was a renowned sculptor. In secret he made these to defend his families Crypt and underground complex. Lord Lionheart was bitten by a Vampire and turned, but he did not suv on to the bloodlust like the Vindale Vampires did. He lived out his days turning his beautiful statues into weapons of war. They were modeled after Diamond Golems but he believed Marble to be the superior Material for the ultimate weapon. In the depths of the Crypt is a very old Lord Lionheart who will attempt to barter a deal to be left alone with a chest of treasure should they give him a chance to make this deal. He will tell them that his original blueprints were taken by the Vindale Vampires so he can only make them from memory but they arenâ€™t perfect like they once were. They Vindale Vampires orchestrated this hit on Lord Lionheart to remove him from the opposing side since he was so adamantly against them.
