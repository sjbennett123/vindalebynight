You Will Know the Lion by his Claw

 

**Written by: Chris Colland**        **Reviewed by:** [Name]




 **Brief**: A Forest Crypt is guarded by mysterious Marble Lion Statues. They seem to have been here for a long time at this point but pristine in upkeep. 




 **Requirements:** Any time Saturday afternoon

**Synopsis**: They belonged to the Lionheart of the pre-adventuring days of Vindale. Lord Lionheart was a renowned sculptor. In secret he made these to defend his families Crypt and underground complex. Lord Lionheart was bitten by a Vampire and turned, but he did not succumb to the bloodlust like the Vindale Vampires did. He lived out his days turning his beautiful statues into weapons of war. They were modeled after Diamond Golems but he believed Marble to be the superior Material for the ultimate weapon. In the depths of the Crypt is a very old Lord Lionheart who will attempt to barter a deal to be left alone with a chest of treasure should they give him a chance to make this deal. He will tell them that his original blueprints were taken by the Vindale Vampires so he can only make them from memory but they aren’t perfect like they once were. The Vindale Vampires orchestrated this hit on Lord Lionheart to remove him from the opposing side since he was so adamantly against them.

**Outcomes**: (1) The PCs fight their way down to Lord Lionheart and choose to let him live as an ally, but he will require a fresh drink of blood.

(2) The PCs kill Lord Lionheart and decline his offer, if they go this route they will have to find a relentless assault of Marble Lions on the way out.

 

**Rumors:** “Statues around town have been vanishing and reappearing in new locations. No rhyme or reason to the movements or who is doing this. Very odd that it just started now and there is no evidence to how it is happening”




 **Hook**: A Vindale Guard comes to town with a report of the Forest Crypt with Marble Lion statues

**Number of Cast Members**: 6

**Roles**: Lord Aurello Lionheart, Marble Lions

**Props**: PC Nobility Clothing for Lord Lionheart, Grey Tabards and White masks for Marble Lions

**Tags and Treasure**: Coins, Components, Production, Cantrip Pages, MI

**Scene 1**: (OOG) Mod Shack (IG) Forest Crypt surrounded by Marble Lions

**Flee Point**: Mod Shack Door (NPCs will pursue)

**Non-Standard Effects**: None

**Rules Clarifications**: None

**Craftsman Information**: None

**Transformations: None**

 **Running Notes**: This module introduces a huge potential ally for PCs. Lord Lionheart was a renaissance man. His main passion was sculpting, and he believed Marble was the purest of stones you could work with. However, he is a Vampire who has learned to live with his curse in his solitude to protect his family treasures. Lion Lionheart is very weak and feeble currently as he hasn’t fed on human blood in years, just animal. If the PCs agree to let him live, he will ask one to fill his goblet with Human blood and that will sustain him for another few years and restore most of his strength. If the PCs let him live, they will be granted access to use the Marble Lions at later times and be marked for protection by them. Lord Lionheart will warn them that the ones the Vindale Vampires stole are called “Nights Stone Marble Lions” and they are just as vicious but infused with vampiric powers. Lord Lionheart has a very strong hatred for the Vindale Vampires as he was put in this cursed state by one nearly 40 years ago. He will even prove his loyalty in killing Vindale Vampires if the PCs require it.
