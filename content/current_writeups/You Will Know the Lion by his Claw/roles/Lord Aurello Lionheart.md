**Lord Aurello Lionheart**

*You were a king of this world when it came to social circle and art. People used to love hearing your voice and their eyes were filled with love when they saw your sculptures. Fate had another plan for you, now you sit alone here in the dark with your empire of dirt. Your famed Marble Lions were your life’s work, now they defend your family’s legacy. You hope to make peace with someone who values your work.*
