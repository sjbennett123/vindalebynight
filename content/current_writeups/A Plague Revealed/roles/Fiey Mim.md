Layout: role

introduction: You have a problem, you like to gamble. A lot. You carry around a bag of chips and a deck of cards just in case anyone is up for a game (alternatively get them in the tavern). You are a great card player and will brag as such. You have come to town looking for a card game. You played cards with Sam the previous week, the night Sam got into town. You were staying at the Half Pony Inn until it was overran with rats. Now you are planning on leaving town that night. You wanted one more card game before you left. You drank from the spring a few days ago. You have a bad cough as well as the green pox.
