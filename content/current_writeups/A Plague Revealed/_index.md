plotline: Contagion
requirements: A Plague Is Born ran

description: Several people are seen near/in the tavern.  They all have a green rash creeping up their necks and on their arms. They are all of differing races, backgrounds, and jobs. But they all one thing in common, they all encountered Sam Nekrov.

synopsis: The full scope of what Sam has done is starting to be seen, as people who met Sam and his phlegm are coming to town. One person is someone that gambled with him, one is the proprietor of the Half Pony Inn, and another is one who traveled on the road into town with Sam. The people are all similarly covered in a green rash along their necks, arms, and hands, are coughing, and are spitting green phlegm (optional). These people seem otherwise healthy, and are in the tavern to get a bite to eat, drink, and mingle with the adventurers. They will take it personal if asked to leave, to cover their mouths, will flip their lid if retained against their will, will complain loudly that they are being persecuted, etc. Channel your inner anti- masker spirit, and turn Karen if confronted or detained.

  -Fiey Mim is a dwarf who has come to town looking for a card game. Fiey played cards with Sam the previous week, the night Sam got into town. Fiey Mim was staying at the Half Pony Inn until it was overran with rats. Now he is planning on leaving town that night. He wanted one more card game before he left.

  -Velray Fisttoe is the owner and sole proprietor of the Half Pony Inn, located on the eastern side of town. Velray met Sam several days ago, when a coughing Sam showed up and asked to sleep in their barn. Velray took pity on Sam, and instead bedded him down in the storehouse and gave the beggar one hot meal a day. Velray is in town seeking a guard to make their patrons feel better about staying in their now overran inn.

  -Colgelga Hillgem is a traveling seasonal worker, in Vindale seeking work with the upcoming harvest. Colgelga barely recalls traveling with a sick man on their way into town, but not much about him. Colgelga recalls their being many sick people though on their way into the city.

   -All three developed the rash a few days previously, and got the cough a few days after meeting Sam.
