schedule: saturday early evening

plotline: Contagion
requirements: A Plague Is Born ran

description: Several people are seen near/in the tavern.  They all have a green pox on their face and hands. They are all of differing races, backgrounds, and jobs. But they all one thing in common, they all drank from the spring in town.

synopsis: The full scope of what the spring has done is starting to be seen, as people who drank from the spring come to town. They also all met Sam at one point or another. One person is someone that gambled with him, one is the proprietor of the Half Pony Inn, and another is one who traveled on the road into town with Sam. The people are all similarly covered in a green pox on their face and hands, are coughing, and are spitting green phlegm (optional). These people seem otherwise healthy, and are in the tavern to get a bite to eat, drink, and mingle with the adventurers. They will take it personal if asked to leave, to cover their mouths, will flip their lid if retained against their will, will complain loudly that they are being persecuted, etc. Channel your inner anti- masker spirit, and turn Karen if confronted or detained.

  -Fiey Mim is a person who has come to town looking for a card game. Fiey played cards with Sam the previous week, the night Sam got into town. Fiey Mim was staying at the Half Pony Inn until it was overran with rats. Now he is planning on leaving town that night. He wanted one more card game before he left. He drank from the spring a few days ago.

  -Velray Fisttoe is the owner and sole proprietor of the Half Pony Inn, located on the eastern side of town. Velray met Sam several days ago, when a coughing Sam showed up and asked to sleep in their barn. Velray took pity on Sam, and instead bedded him down in the storehouse and gave the beggar one hot meal a day. Velray is in town seeking a guard to make their patrons feel better about staying in their now overran inn.

  -Colgelga Hillgem is a traveling seasonal worker, in Vindale seeking work with the upcoming harvest. Colgelga barely recalls traveling with a sick man on their way into town, but not much about him. Colgelga recalls their being many sick people though on their way into the city. Colgelga drank from the spring when she entered town.

   -All three developed the pox recently, and had a green rash before the pox showed up.
