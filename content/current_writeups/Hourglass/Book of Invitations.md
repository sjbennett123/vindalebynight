### Courting the Spiral 

**Components**: 10P 5D 5T

When cast it will begin a slow but deadly process of replacing much of the ability of those that are able to read with the read magic skill to no longer be able to read in the traditional sense instead seeing an Oraborus spiral in place of the writing that this would normally be expected. In game terms every character within 30 miles of the casting PC or NPC will need to roll D% as if they were rolling on the backlash table and consult the table below. The effects on the various characters last for 1 year from the casting. 

| D%     | Result                                                       |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1-10   | Unaffected                                                   |
| 11-75  | Every day 50% chance to be unable to use read magic or to read traditional writing without tremendous effort. |
| 76-100 | As 11-75 but 100% of the time                                |

Additionally for every character that rolls a 76-100 result run the module "Lurking Horror" which details the terrible creatures that have been brought through by the latent ritual that all of the readers of the spiral have become. Lastly it is known to all creatures of extraplanar nature that the area that this ritual has had this ritual enacted on is now tainted and if at all possible they will avoid this cursed place. 

### Inviting the Sleeper

**Components**: 10P 5D 5T

This ritual must be cast on a willing target. This places the essence of the Sleeper of Nagios in the target and it will begin to dominate the thoughts and emotions of it's host. This acts as both a Transform and a high level of craftman other skills. At the end of one year the sleeper will depart and the host will feel a terrible sense of loss as they will never be able to carry him again.
