plotline: 
requirements: 

description: A sealed chest has been discovered in an abandoned building near Vindale, but no one can figure out the lock on it.
synopsis: The lock can only be opened from a Cold Iron Key that a random merchant will be selling for 10 Gold during the weekend. The Merchant tells them “This will lead you to a treasure, but it will be dangerous”. DFM does not work on the box as one scholar already tried. The lock is holding back 3 Gaseous form Vampires locked in a box in pure blood frenzy. This was an early prototype solution for no Stake of Woe to deal with a Vampire. The Blackthorne Family crest is burnt into the inside of the box. When the box opens the 3 Vampires come clawing out of Gaseous Form trying to kill for a blood bath to sate their insanity.
outcomes: 
  - The PCs put it together about the key they may have bought and the box they need to unlock the box with.
  - The PCs don’t realize they have the key to unlocking the Blackthorne Box and the Vampires remained trapped

running_notes: This module is a hidden module. A merchant will sell a player a Cold Iron Key for 10G. He will warn them that them “This will lead you to a treasure, but it will be dangerous”. The Box cannot be destroyed by any means currently known. This was Blackthorne magic from another timeline where magic was very different. Vincent Blackthorn will be very happy to see this box and proud of the PCs for discovering it for him. Only Vincent knows how to open the box, to open the box the blood of a Hunter must be spilled on the lock if the key isn’t present, and this is how they magically seal the box. The Vampires that come from the box are very strong but there are only 3 of them. Given their unknown time in the box, these must have been elders, but they are on their last Stake of Woe life. If the PCs killing blow them with a Stake of Woe then they ash instantly.
