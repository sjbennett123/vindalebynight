  When the adventurers finally make their way into final vault, they are met with the blood roots. These blood roots are rooted in place where they are. These roots respawn every 30 seconds until the root behind them is pulled up and burned (one the NPC is beaten down, they will kneel in place, count to 30, then respawn on a count of 'I regrow one, I regrow two, I regrow 3. NPCs who's vine is gone need to  travel to another intact vine and respawn there. No vine goes out of game until the last root is pulled). Once every vine has been beaten back, pulled, and burned, the adventurers are paid.
