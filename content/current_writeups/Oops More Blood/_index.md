description: The les Sangsues Abyssale get help with his Blood tainted vines that he used to make the wine for the town. 

synopsis: |

  The les Sangsues Abyssale has come to town. He has a problem. Deep underground, in his aging vaults, a red, tentacle like, violent vine has grown through the walls. Unfortunately, he is unable to take care of the problem himself, and is seeking help from the adventurers in town, and will first try to get help for free but will eventually offer to pay for the help.   
  
  The adventurers are led to the entrance by Abyssale, given several torches, and told to make their way into the deepest part of the aging vault. The vines are growing out of the wall in that area. The torches can not be sat down, and must be carried at all times. If the torch hits the ground, it will go out. The torches are to burn the vines. As the PCs make their way deeper, they meet more and bigger blood tainted rats and spiders. Antechamber level 1 is Blood Spiders and Blood Tainted Rats (5 spawns each), level 2 is Blood Spiders and Dire Blood Tainted Rats (5 spiders, 10 rats), and level 3 is Dire Blood Spiders and Dire Blood Tainted Rats (10 spiders and 15 rats) 
  
  When the adventurers finally make their way into final vault, they are met with the blood roots. These blood roots are tied with a length of rope duct taped to the floor in front of the 'roots' on the wall (red streamers). The Blood Roots, when beaten down, will respawn on a count of 15, where ever they dropped. When the root behind them is pulled up, the blood root npcs in front of that root will migrate to an intact root on the wall, and so on until all the roots are killed and the blood roots can't respawn anymore. 
  
  Once the Blood Roots are killed, the PCs will not be able to find at les Sangsues Abyssale at the entrance to get paid.
  
outcomes: 
  - The vines are pulled up and burned, Adventurers figure out that they have been drinking, and get stiffed on payment
  - The PCs lose the ability to burn the roots, they remain.
