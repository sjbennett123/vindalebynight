description: Overwhelmed, the patron of les Sangsues Abyssale has come to the town, seeking aid. 

synopsis: |
  Scene set up- The mod shack needs be as dimly lit as safely possible. Each of the three 'chambers' is filled with blood tainted rats, and spiders, and nothing else. The end vault has leaky crates of wine with varying descriptions in each crate. On the walls are taped lines of twisted streamers up the walls. These are the vine roots. The NPCs playing vines need to be clustered in place around these roots. 
  
  The les Sangsues Abyssale (pronounced less Sang-sus Abby-sale) has come to town. He has a problem. Deep underground, in his aging vaults, a red, tentacle like, violent vine has grown through the walls. Unfortunately, he is unable to take care of the problem himself, and is seeking help from the adventurers in town, and will first try to get help for free but will eventually offer to pay for the help.   
  
  The adventurers are led to the entrance by Abyssale, given several torches, and told to make their way into the deepest part of the aging vault. The vines are growing out of the wall in that area. The torches are not just for light, they are to kill the vines, as the Abysale's servants found this to be the only thing that kept them at bay. As they make their way deeper, they meet more and bigger blood tainted animals; rats and spiders.  
  
  When the adventurers finally make their way into final vault, they are met with the blood roots. These blood roots are rooted in place where they are. These roots will respawn every 30 seconds until the root behind them is pulled up and burned (one the NPC is beaten down, they will kneel in place, count to 30, then respawn on a count of 'I regrow one, I regrow two, I regrow 3. NPCs who's vine is gone need to  travel to another intact vine and respawn there. No vine goes out of game until the last root is pulled). Once every vine has been beaten back, pulled, and burned, the adventurers are paid.
