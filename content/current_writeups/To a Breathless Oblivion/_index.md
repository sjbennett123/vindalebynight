description: Locked away in a stone crypt, a layer of red vines wrapping across the door, sleeps a family crypt of restless angry spirits who are bound here and seek release but have been driven mad by the visions they have seen for 20 years. Their physical bodies are perfectly preserved in their sarcophagus but their faces are frozen with anguish and horror. From their bodies rise Wraiths of pure Madness, these spirits want others to be driven to Oblivion aswell and will not rest until slaughtered. These are mercy killings, once the Wraith is defeated from each body, they will return the essence to the corpse and the decay will instantly appear, the soul will pass on freely now to the other side and a reward of treasure will be where the final Wraith was slain.
