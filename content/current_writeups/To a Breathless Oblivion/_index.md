To a Breathless Oblivion

 

**Written by: Chris Colland**        **Reviewed by:** [Name]




 **Brief**: Locked away in a stone crypt, a layer of red vines wrapping across the door, sleeps a family crypt of restless angry spirits who are bound here and seek release but have been driven mad by the visions they have seen for 20 years.




 **Requirements:** Anytime on Saturday Afternoon or Night

 

**Synopsis**: Their physical bodies are perfectly preserved in their sarcophagus but their faces are frozen with anguish and horror. From their bodies rise Wraiths of pure Madness, these spirits want others to be driven to Oblivion aswell and will not rest until slaughtered. These are mercy killings, once the Wraith is defeated from each body, they will return the essence to the corpse and the decay will instantly appear, the soul will pass on freely now to the other side and a reward of treasure will be where the final Wraith was slain.

 

**Outcomes**: (1) The PCs defeat the Madness Wraiths and put the souls to eternal rest

(2) The PCs do not end the anguish and the Wraiths will manifest later to hunt down the PCs, also no treasure is found if the Wraiths are not ALL killed

 

**Rumors:** “The seasonal wildlife of Vindale has begun to stir… Fast moving shadows and glowing eyes have become common sightings outside the city walls now…”




 **Hook**: A member of the Blackthorn Family comes to town with a recently discovered Crypt door covered in a layer of red vines wrapping across the door. This just appeared today

**Number of Cast Members**: 7

**Roles**: Silas (M) or Luna (F) Blackthorne, Madness Wraith x6

**Props**: White Tabards /w Red Markings of Anguish, PC Style Clothing for Blackthorne

**Tags and Treasure**: Coins, Components, Production, Cantrip Pages

**Scene 1**: (OOG) Mod Shack (IG) Stone Crypt with red vines wrapping across door.

**Flee Point**: Mod Shack Door

**Non-Standard Effects**: None

**Rules Clarifications**: None

**Craftsman Information**: None

**Transformations:** Undead Hunter

 **Running Notes**: This module is a mercy killing of anguished souls that were unable to cross over till now. The Red Vines on the door are some form of Curse of Anguish given their attempting of 20 years has manifested pure hate. Now that there is a chance to be fixed given the ley lines are in balance now, the Souls can Passover now if defeated. The PCs will enter and investigate the 6 bodies are perfectly preserved and not a sign of decay. After a moment for investigation, the Madness Wraiths spawn in corners of the room and attack relentlessly.
