description: There are 4 “beacons” that have a platform pedestal to set an object. The “beacons” will set off “randomly” and that will turn off different “barriers” and make different “rooms” accessible in the “Tarp Maze” to seal and unseal rooms for objects they need to get to build a statue to progress further to the treasure
