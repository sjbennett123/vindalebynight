synopsis: The House of Sanguinius Nocturna are obsessed with Alchemical perfection of the Flesh. The Sanguinus Flesh Beast is their greatest creation in recent memory, but they require fresh flesh once a year like the Vampires require Blood to survive. They have been stalking the woods seeking fresh flesh to consume to sustain themselves but they have not been lucky in their harvest. As a result they have become desperate and begun digging up a public Graveyard in the forest. At this point dead flesh is better than nothing, it is the equivalent to a Vampire drinking Animal blood when feral and on the verge of Bloodlust. This was observed by a merchant on the road and he comes to town quickly and out of breath absolutely horrified that he saw these Flesh Beasts eating corpses.  
outcomes: 
  - The Bloody Shadow Attercob Assassins are defeated and they are gone for now…
  - The Bloody Shadow Attercob Assassins pursue the fleeing PCS to the towns edge and then lurk in the darkness till they find a victim for 30 minutes after the module…

running_notes: This module introduces the main war monster of the House Sanguinus Nocturna, the Flesh Beast. An abomination made of flesh and alchemy. This beast sustains on flesh alone like a Vampire feed on blood. When the players encounter the beasts, they are in a “blood frenzy” and feasting on dead flesh. To these beasts this is a last resort, like Vampires avoid animal blood, dead flesh isn’t nearly as nourishing as living or freshly killed flesh. The PCs will find them in the middle of a feeding frenzy in a small graveyard, normally they are not like this.
