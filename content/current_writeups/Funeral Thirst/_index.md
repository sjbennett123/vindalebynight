description: The House of Sanguinius Nocturna are obsessed with Alchemical and perfection of the Flesh. Sanguinus Flesh Beast have been their greatest creation in recent memory, but they require fresh flesh once a year like the Vampires require Blood to survive. They have been stalking the woods seeking fresh flesh to consume to sustain themselves but they have not been as lucky in their harvest. As a result they have become desperate and begun digging up a public Graveyard in the forest. At this point dead flesh is better than nothing, it is the equivalent to a Vampire drinking Animal blood when Feral and on the verge of Bloodlust. This was observed by a merchant on the road and he comes to town quickly and out of breath absolutely horrified that he saw these Flesh Beasts eating corpses.
