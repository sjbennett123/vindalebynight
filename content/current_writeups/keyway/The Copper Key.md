title: The Copper Key
---
The copper key is an ancient artifact and provides the bearer access to any area no matter the warding or protections shattering wards, circles of power and other enchantments with ease. 

Sadly the manner with which this power is granted comes at a great cost. A lock is not simply a manner of securing a building but is also a message that this place is to be private and the flagrant disregard that the Copper Key represents draws the ire of the forces of Order who desire respect for the traditions of entry. Every time the Copper Key is used there is a chance that it draws attention from the Plane of Order particularly "The Judge of Changing Times" a powerful entity who ensures that none of the changes of society come too abruptly and that the traditions are respected.

To use the Copper Key a single destruction component is consumed as well as a 5 minute ritual following all standard formal magic rules where the key is focused upon. Then at the conclusion of this ritual any target of the Copper Key is subject to the effects of a Destroy Formal Magic. Anyone that is within a Ward or Circle of Power that is destroyed in this manner feels stunned by this powerful magic. Roll a D10 on a result of 8-10 the Judge of Changing times is alerted to the presence of the copper key and will be arriving to make his displeasure known.
