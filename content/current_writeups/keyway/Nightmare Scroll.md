Hear us, Ancient One!

Hear us, Restless One!

Hear us, Cuel one!

We beseech you ...

All who wake know the power of nightares.

All who wake feel the touch  of nightmare.

All who wake feel nightamare's truth

We lay ourselves on your harch mercyt. accept us into your kngdom show us the turths we must see

Lead to into your lands lord of the long night.

To show our dedication to you, we offer these false gifts of your eternal rival. We give them freely. We entrust these glimmers of unearned  light into your dark stern hands. We accept your truths.

I <Name> relinquish you this my most preciosu dream 

<Says Dream> 

and now it is my nightmare.

<drink> 

<Chorus> lead us to your lands lord of this long night.
