Into the Everblack: The game opens with the players coming into town, along the road are blue/purple torches and Orc heads impaled on spikes. Standing infront of the Tavern is a member of the Blackthorn hunter family cloaked in black hiding their face handing out the “Blackthorne’s Guide to Surviving Vindale” to the new coming adventurers. The cloaked information vendor will tell them that new adventures haven’t been to Vindale in 3 years now
