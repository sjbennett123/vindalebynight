synopsis:  A message is delivered by owl to the Adventurers from the Blackthorne Hunter Family, directions are provided but they will warn them about the Bonebreakers savagery. Sent from the hall of the Shattered Bone Clan of Vampires, the Shattered Bonebreakers have begun a cull on a small village just east of Vindale. These troopers are typically sent in as shock troops before the grand assault by the Vindale Vampires commences. The Village was known to be harboring Various Lycans who were hiding from the Vindale Vampires. It is law in Vindale that if you are openly transformed into your Lycan war form that you are allowed to be slain in the streets, Lycans have been deemed too dangerous to trust when in their war form.
outcomes: 
  - The PCs arrive and defeat the Shattered Bonebreakers, all the full Lycan warriors are dead by the time they arrive. A group of lycan-blooded survivors come to town later with a reward.
  - The PCs donâ€™t defeat all the Bonebreakers and the entire village is killed

running_notes: This module introduces one of the main shock troops of the Vindale Vampires, the Shattered Bonebreakers. These monsters are pure walls of bone, armor, and blunt force. They hunt while the Vampires sleep. They are perfect killing machines that can walk the daylight without harm. These creatures are essential undead golems with no means to communicate, just follow simple orders from the Vindale Vampires. The Bonebreakers have been sent to eradicate all Lycan life that they can find.
