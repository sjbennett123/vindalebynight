description: Sent from the hall of the Shattered Bone Clan of Vampires, the Shattered Bonebreakers have begun a cull on a small village just east of Vindale. These troopers are typically sent in as shocktroops before the grand assault by the Vindale Vampires commences. The Village was known to be harboring Various Lycans who were hiding from the Vindale Vampires. It is law in Vindale that if you are openly transformed into your Lycan war form that you are allowed to be slain in the streets, Lycans have been deemed too dangerous to trust when in their war form. A message is delivered from an animal to the Adventurers via the Blackthorne Hunter Family, directions are provided but they will warn them about the Bonebreakers savagery.
