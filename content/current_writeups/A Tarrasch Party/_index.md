synopsis: |

  This is a diplomacy/role play module.
  
  A messenger hired by a local vampire family has been tasked to deliver an invitation to a targeted adventuring group. These adventurers need to have prior contact with the Tarrasch and the Bishop from the Tarrasch Plotline of Stonewood. 
  
  The note reads "We wish to discuss with you a possible alliance match-up. We, how shall we say, share a common interest. Please come at your earliest convenience, as time is short as the festival nears. I am also an avid lover of chess and would love a spirited game, if you will so oblige. I find discussing important matters over chess to be quite productive." Then signed in a flowing signature "Alderik Crinamorte" In the tail of the 'E' or somewhere close to the end, is a small, simple drawing of a Rook.
  
  Once the invitation has been delivered, and the group can then make their way to the home of the Crinamorte Vampire Clan. They are not an old clan, but have been in the region long enough to have established winery. They are liked in Vindale. They own a small, but wildly successful vineyard in the area, and employ many people of all races. They are more tolerant of the living than most vampires, and this has made them mildly unpopular with the local clans. They aren't apart of the politics of the area.    
  
  When the adventuring group gets there (the guard NPCs preferably need to be around the corner, out of sight), they find the door open and the bodies of both on the floor. The scene is a blood bath, and the room is destroyed. Clutched in the hand of one of the bodies is a piece of paper with the Tarrasch symbol.  The PCs are given 30-45 seconds to examine the scene after the paper is found, before the Vindale Guard shows up (on signal from the mod marshal). When the guards show up, they will confront the PCs. They will insist on the group dropping their weapons and spells forcefully. The group is then striped of weapons and arrested. "Restraints" are placed on their wrists (figure 8 loops that can be grasped or big enough to safely rep) 
  
  (If the adventurers mistakenly or purposely kill the guards/Captain Vintrel, a bigger, badder group will come and get them and the arrest will proceed as written.)
  
  The group is then taken to jail though a route that takes them near the Tavern, or within sight of the tavern. The message in doing this is the guard is showing off "Look what we got, better not step out of line" Once at the jail, they speak to the Captain of the Guard Dyinn Vintrel. The jail needs to have a circle of power, and the adventurers are placed within, hand restraints removed.
  
  The Captain, knowing the groups reputation and status, will allow them to talk and with persuasion (and with medium to much difficulty), convince Vintrel that they are innocent. If they are successful, the Captain will task them to prove it. 
  
  The Captain will suggest they track the group that killed the vampires, if such a group does exists. They will have to put up collateral in coin or magic items (either three platinum each or one magic item each) in order to be set free to track the group that killed the family and bring back proof that they are innocent. If they are successful in bringing proof, they will get all their items back. (If no PC tracker exists, the Captain will "offer the services of one of the human trackers in employ." He offers these services to them anytime after first light.)
  
  If they succeed in proving their innocence in any way, convince the Captain to let them track the assassin(s), and also mention the one they hunt is a Litch at any time, Captain Vintrel will return Saturday Night and speak to them again. The vampires will offer help/an alliance in hunting the Litch. 
  
outcomes:
  - They cannot convince the Captain of their innocence, and are fined, striped of all weapons, and are kept under watch during the feast days until they leave Vindale. They are given their items back at this time.

  - They convince the Captain that they could be innocent and are allowed to go and bring back proof. The Captain suggests they track the group that did it, if they exist. 

  - They UNDOUBTLY convince the Captain that they are innocent, by giving any proof that the group was able to gather at Stonewood. An alliance is formed right away with Captain Vintrel.
