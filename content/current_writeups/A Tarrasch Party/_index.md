description: adventurers are framed for the murder of a local group of vampires and need to negotiate an escape from the vindale jail. 

synopsis: |

 Thomas Cypher delivers an invitation requesting the presence of a specific adventuring group(Clinton, Chris, and Bobby) by a group of local vampires. When they arrive at Crinamorte Mansion, they find their vampire hosts slain, and a piece of paper baring the Tarrasch symbol found clutched in a hand. Vindale guards, alerted to the murder by an anonymous source, rush to the scene. The adventurers are arrested and transported to the local jail, where they must convince the Captain of their innocence.


  
  A messenger hired by a local vampire family has been delivers an invitation to a specific adventuring group(Clinton, Chris, and Bobby)
  
  Once the invitation has been delivered, and the group can then make their way to the home of the 
  
  When the adventuring group gets there (the guard NPCs preferably need to be around the corner, out of sight), they find the door open and the bodies of both on the floor. Clutched in the hand of one of the bodies is a piece of paper with the Tarrasch symbol. The PCs are given 30-45 seconds to examine the scene after the paper is found, before the Vindale Guard shows up (on signal from the mod marshal). When the guards show up, the group is striped of weapons and arrested. "Restraints" are placed on their wrists (figure 8 loops that can be grasped or big enough to safely rep) 
  

  
  The captive players taken to the vindale jail though a route that takes them near the Tavern, or within sight of the tavern. The message in doing this is the guard is showing off "Look what we got, better not step out of line" Once at the jail, they speak to the Captain of the Guard Dyinn Vintrel. The adventurers are placed within a circle of power and and hand restraints are removed.
  
  The Captain, knowing the groups reputation and status, will allow them to talk and with persuasion (and with medium to much difficulty), convince Vintrel that they are innocent. If they are successful, the Captain will task them to prove it. 
  
  The Captain will suggest they track the group that killed the vampires, if such a group does exists. They will have to put up collateral in coin or magic items (either three platinum each or one magic item each) in order to be set free to track the group that killed the family and bring back proof that they are innocent. If they are successful in bringing proof, they will get all their items back. (If no PC tracker exists, the Captain will "offer the services of one of the human trackers in employ." He offers these services to them anytime after first light.)
  
  If they succeed in proving their innocence in any way, convince the Captain to let them track the assassin(s), and also mention the one they hunt is a Litch at any time, Captain Vintrel will return Saturday Night and speak to them again. The vampires will offer help/an alliance in hunting the Litch. 
  
outcomes:
  -   If the adventurers kill the guards or Captain Vintrel run the module I am the law. 
  - They cannot convince the Captain of their innocence, and are fined, striped of all weapons, and are kept under watch during the feast days until they leave Vindale. They are given their items back at this time.
  - They convince the Captain that they could be innocent and are allowed to go and bring back proof. The Captain suggests they track the group that did it, if they exist. 
  - They UNDOUBTLY convince the Captain that they are innocent, by giving any proof that the group was able to gather at Stonewood. An alliance is formed with Captain Vintrel.
