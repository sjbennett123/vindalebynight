Army Of The Night

Army of the Night

 

 

**Written by: Chris Colland**        **Reviewed by:** [Name] 
 
**Brief**: Shortly after the adventurers reach the City of Vindale and enter the Tavern. A swarm of Wolves of the Feral Hunt and Bats of Sanguine Reaping descend on the town of Vindale. Their numbers seem vast and relentless, after some time they will pull back once they have tested these new adventurers. 
**Requirements:** Into the Everblack has been run

 

**Synopsis**: A large group of new adventurers have arrived in Vindale. The courts are curious about the prowess of this new breed with the recent power shift among the Houses and Clans. With the Harvest Festival looming overhead, the Courts want things to go well, if the Adventurers can survive the “minions” of Vindale they might have a use later as the last batch of “heroes” died the first night.

 

**Outcomes**: (1) The Army of the Night is released on Vindale and they are “recalled” after a set amount of time of relentless assault, if they fight and stand their ground, they will be deemed “Worthy” by the Courts

(2) The PCs attempt to hide and outlast the assault, if they run and hide they will be deemed “Cowards” by the Courts

 

**Rumors:** “A dark cloud begins to cover Woodhaven. The skies are overcast with a green hue. The flora is more vibrant and begins to glow in the moonlight.” 
**Hook**: Shortly after Into the Everblack has concluded, sounds of the Army of the Night are played as the assault begins.

**Running Notes**: This module is the opening show of force by the Vindale Courts. They do not want to kill the adventurers but they wont go easy on them. They hope this breed of Hero is stronger than the last one that failed the test 2 years ago. The Army of the Night will assault the town for roughly 20 minutes with resets all over the place non-stop. When you die, drop your treasure and reset as quickly as possible. If you have any treasure left after the mod is over, return it to the NPC shack for later use.
