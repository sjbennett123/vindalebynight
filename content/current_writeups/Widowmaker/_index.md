**Written by: Chris Colland**        **Reviewed by:** [Name]




 **Brief**: A new breed of Bloody Fist Spiders are unleashed in a “Trial Run” on Vindale but the blame is pinned on Vindale Vampires.




 **Requirements:** Servants to the Horde has been ran (wait 3 hours)

 

**Synopsis**: These spiders are fed Silver to let them absorb it into their Carapace to imbue their bodies with silver claw talons to fight Lycans. Vindale is the perfect testing ground for the Bloody Fist for the Bloody Widowmakers, who would suspect the Bloody Fist to build spiders when the Vampires would take the blame.

 

**Outcomes**: (1) The PCs encounter a wave of these spiders hunting Lycans only, if they don’t attack the Widowmakers will continue until they find a Lycan.

(2) The PCs slay the wave of Widowmakers, they see another skitter off away from them, if they pursue, they are led to a second scene of a dead Lycan and silver coins scattered around his corpse, some are half eaten.

 

**Rumors:** “The seasonal wildlife of Vindale has begun to stir… Fast moving shadows and glowing eyes have become common sightings outside the city walls now…”




 **Hook**: The Widowmakers come to town looking for any Lycans they can find to eat

 **Running Notes**: This module introduces a new creature for the Bloody Fist, the Bloody Widowmaker. With dealing with so many Lycans already in the war, Orcamedes went to work after the success of the Gnawing Ones. The Widowmakers are very vicious if you fight them in a group but one on one they aren’t as bad. They won’t attack a non-Lycan unless ordered to. They would right past a group of people, but they can “sense” Lycans within 20ft of them.
