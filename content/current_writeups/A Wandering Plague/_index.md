description: Sam Nekruv-Ratman, a wandering beggar, has entered Vindale in search of charity. 

synopsis: |
  A wandering beggar has come to Vindale, asking for charity. Sam, the beggar, 

  He enters town at a slow walk to not aggravate the cough, his movements are easy as to not make the coughing worse. He will approach and ask everyone for spare coin or any charity at all. He will trade a story from his travels for a coin if you wish! He promises they are worth the price. He says has had the cough for several weeks, and has traveled with it. It got significantly worse as he neared Vindale, and now he can't work because he loses his breath just talking.  He speaks of his travels, as a vagabond, and what he has seen. He talks fondly but little of his daughter, of how he wasn't a good father and she didn't deserve that. She would be a woman now, he says. No, it's been too long, he can't go back. That's all he will say on the subject, and will change it soon after. He has been all over the land, wandering, begging, and taking odd jobs when he can. He just recently started coughing up the green phlegm. He says he attends Market Days because of the coin and treasure he hears is obtained. No, he has never adventured. Yes, he would like to, once this cough goes away, but he has no money for equipment or a party to adventure with. He will listen and take any advice eagerly. His personality needs to make up for the grossness that is his cough.

  When the coughing gets to be too much (aka npc too hot, out of phlegm, no one engaging anymore) the beggar will leave the area.
