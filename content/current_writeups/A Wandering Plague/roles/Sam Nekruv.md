**Terrible Cough**:  When you talk, it's like you are holding back a cough, clearing your throat, little coughs, until you can't take it. Take a drink of the flask (phlegm container) and then cough hard, spitting out green phlegm and coughing your head off. This lasts an uncomfortably long time, but not so long as to be considered comedy. You just recently started coughing up the green phlegm. You have had the cough for several weeks, and have traveled with it. It got significantly worse as you neared Vindale, and now you can't work because you lose your breath just talking. 

**Aggressive Begger**: Approach everyone, asking for coin or if they would like to hear a story for coin. Your stories are fanciful and dramatic, and you won't say if they are true or not. You attend Market Days because of the coin and treasure you hear is obtained but have never adventured. You have been all over the land, wandering, begging, and taking odd jobs when you can. You speak of your travels, as a vagabond, and what you have seen.  

**Deadbeat Dad**: You talk fondly of your daughter, Ruth. You were not a good father and she didn't deserve that. She would be a woman now. It's been too long and you can't go back. That is all you will say on the subject, and will abruptly change it.
