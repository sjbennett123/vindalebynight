introduction:  
    You enter town at a slow walk so as not to aggravate the cough. You will approach and ask everyone for spare coin or any charity at all. You will trade a story from your travels for a coin if you wish! You promise they are worth the price. You say you have had the cough for several weeks, and have traveled with it. It got significantly worse as you neared Vindale, and now you can't work because you lose your breath just talking.  You speak of your travels, as a vagabond, and what you have seen. You talk fondly but very little of his daughter, of how you wasn't a good father and she didn't deserve that. She would be a woman now, you say. No, it's been too long, you can't go back. That's all you will say on the subject, and will change it soon after. You have been all over the land, wandering, begging, and taking odd jobs when you can. You just recently started coughing up the green phlegm. You say you attend Market Days because of the coin and treasure you hear is obtained. No, you has never adventured. Yes, you would like to, once this cough goes away, but you have no money for equipment or a party to adventure with. You will listen and take any advice eagerly. Your personality needs to make up for the grossness that is your cough. When you talk, it's like you are holding back a cough, clearing your throat, little coughs, until you can't take it, you will take a drink of his flask (phlegm container) and then cough hard, spitting out green phlegm and coughing your head off. This lasts an uncomfortably long time, but not so long as to be considered comedy.
