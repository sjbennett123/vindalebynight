The beggar has a nasty cough and frequently spits out mouthfuls of green phlegm, wiping his mouth with a green stained handkerchief. He enters town, talks, begs money, and leaves. 

is easy to talk to and likable. He gives no reason to be unlikable, except his cough, which he can't help, no matter how hard he tries. He needs to leave an impression of likable pity when he leaves a conversation.  He has a nasty bad cough that frequently brings up green colored phlegm, leaving him breathless and wheezing. When he talks, its like he is holding back a cough, clearing his throat, little coughs, until he can't take it, he will take a drink of his flask (phlegm container) and then cough hard, spitting out green phlegm and coughing his head off. This lasts an uncomfortably long time, but not so long as to be considered comedy. It needs to be very uncomfortable to be near him. He will also randomly erupt in a coughing fit. He has on him a handkerchief stained green and a flask that he takes frequent drinks of (phlegm container). He is heavily cloaked, even if it's a hot day.
