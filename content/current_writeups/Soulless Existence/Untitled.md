Soulless Existence: The Clocktower in Vindale is under attack by large clockwork golems. Something in the clocktower seems to be drawing them to the place but it is unclear what until they are dealt with. Inside is an agent outside of time the Golems were hunting, he has on him a book in a language that isn’t native to Elysia. The book is what is drawing the Golems towards it. The book reads as Time Magic but when you can read the words in translation, it was written in a Void language. The Golem want the book to be destroyed, the Agent wants to escape after stealing it from the Vindale Vampire Library. It’s up to the Adventurers who gets to keep the book or if it is destroyed. The Void language in the book is for a summoning ritual of Void creatures.
