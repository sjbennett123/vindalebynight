Feihlen Brighthelm, a wealthy trader,  always had an affinity for animals and creatures of all kinds. He knows about the animals and creatures on Elysia better than anyone. He runs Humans for the Ethical Treatment Of Creatures or HETOC, an organization advocating for better treatment off all creatures. 

Publicly, Feihlen Brighthelm is a patron for animal welfare and creature awareness. He is vocal about how adventurers disrupt otherwise peaceful creatures, and how Market Days should be forgone, and trade routes put in their place. He is addiment that it is the adventurers who cause the chaos that is during and after Market Days, and they should be stopped (think PETA, and he's in charge). 

Privately, Feihlen Brighthelm has spent his life seeking out prime specimens and studying them and experimenting on them. Feihlen has dissected almost every living creature on Elysia. He spliced species into horrible abominations. He carried out experiments using chaos, void, and elemental magics on his creatures, and keeps a menagerie full of his experiments on his large, but well guarded, land. No one is allowed there, except by invitation. 

Feihlen Brighthelm the most heinous of his experiments on living subjects. He  created flesh golems made from the corpses of his animal experiments, and uses these instead of humanoid helpers. He infused all manner of magic into the creatures, including void, chaos, elemental, and dream. All of this was done while maintaining his good public image.
