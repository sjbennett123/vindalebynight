> Rats!
> 
> They fought the dogs, and killed the cats,
> 
> 	And bit the babies in the cradles,
> 
> And eat the cheeses out of the vats,
> 
> 	And licked the soup from the cooks' own ladles,
> 
> Split open the kegs of salted sprats,
> 
> Made nests inside men's Sunday hats,
> 
> And even spoiled the women's chats
> 
> 	By drowning their speaking
> 
> 	With shrieking and squeaking
> 
> In fifty different sharps and flats.
