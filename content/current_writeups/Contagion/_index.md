Sam Nekrov is a vagabond, and as he neared Vindale, developed a cough and started coughing up green phlegm. As his condition worsens, he sends for someone he knows, so he can convey a letter. Before he is able to do so, Sam explodes into a swarm of dire chaos rats. The dire chaos rats continue to plague the town.

There is a spring in town that has been spelled to give the drinker a Cure Light Wounds potion once. But as time goes on, those who drank from the spring have developed a green rash. Also, the dire chaos rats avoid anyone who has drank from the spring. 

Three people show up in the tavern, all sporting the same green "holey lotus" pox. They have all drank from the spring, and their green rash developed into the pox.

A black deer with glowing green antlers show up in town with a missive and antidote from Feihlen Brighthelm. He instructs the adventurers on how to cleanse the spring, and rid themselves of the pox.
