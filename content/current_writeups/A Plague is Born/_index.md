description: A runner brings a note into town, looking for friends of Sam Nekruv. The note begs for them to come at once, that the coughing is worse, and he is scared. Upon arrival, the adventures see Sam Nekruv, who is coughing worse than he did in town. He begs for them to not get too close. Eventually, his coughing will become worse and continuous. The scene will be then become enveloped by green smoke. Sam shrieks and falls to the floor, his cloak empty. Erupting from the once-body of Sam is a plague of Dire Chaos Rats.   

synopsis: |
  A person, Oh Aom, was passing by and was given a couple silver to deliver a note to the friends of Sam Nekruv in town, at the tavern. The deliverer, Oh Aom, seems sleazy, just gives off those vibes. He says he delivered the note "out of the kindness of his heart", and "the man didn't look like he had long on this earth", but still shamelessly took the silver from a dying homeless man. He says was already headed into the tavern and told the man he would deliver the note. No, he does not know Sam, never seen him before. When/if asked for directions, he counters with an offer of the directions for a Platinum, two Platinum and he'll take them there, but he is willing to negotiate for less. He will cave if threatened or roughed up. He will lead them there if threatened and demanded, or paid and asked. He is a spineless weasel looking for a free payday, and the encounter with him should reflect that. If the PCs show up at the Mod Shack without directions, they will be instructed to find directions and come back. Oh will not go out of game until the directions are given or he takes them there. Sam is located in the storehouse of The Half Pony Inn, located east of the tavern, in a not so nice part of town.

  Directions- Sam Nekruv is staying in the storehouse at the back of the Half Pony Inn, east of the tavern. 

  The note reads "Friends, please come at once. I feel weak and don't know if I'll make it though. I wish not to be alone, and I wish to send a letter to my daughter. You are the only ones I have to ask this favor of. Please, make haste. -Sam Nekruv"

  (ALTERNATE IF NO ONE BEFRIENDS SAM IN A WANDERING PLAGUE- A letter is delivered to the adventureres from the city, requesting the adventurers look into a beggar in the warehouse district that was seen wandering around town. They are asked to investigate the beggar and see if a cure for his sickness can be found, or "another alternative sought if no cure is found". The letter reads "To the adventurers in Vindale, we have been made aware of a sick individual roaming our city, begging for handouts. Please seek out this individual at the Half Pony Inn on the East side of town. Please cure him or otherwise find an alternative to remove him, if no cure is found.")

  Once the adventurers show up at the Inn, if they choose to enter the Inn, they will find it dimly lit, full of smoke, and smelling sour. The innkeeper will approach and flirt, asking what these handsome young adventurers are doing in this part of town. The innkeeper will freely admit to letting a sick man stay in their storehouse for free because they felt bad for him. They will say that the storehouse is unlocked if the adventurers wish to go back there. The Inn is hazy do to the fact of everyone smoking indoors and the fireplace is drafted improperly and spews smoke.

  When the adventurers chose to enter the storehouse, it is very hazy. The smell of infection is apparent to all that can smell the haze (ie, you smell the fog, you smell the infection). If there happens to be a Scavenger in the group, they will almost be driven from the area by the smell. The adventurers will be greeted by a coughing Sam at the very back of the storehouse (NPCs are outside the side door). He will tell them to stay back in between coughs. He will be adamant that they stay away, and will become agitated if approached. He will say that he wants to dictate a letter to his daughter. He says that he knows he doesn't have long, he can't breathe and he knows there isn't any hope at this point. Nothing will change his mind, and he will insist between coughs that they need to send the letter. He can say that if he somehow survives, he will go see his daughter. He will become an adventurer like them. He will cough and wheeze and insist on the letter. Once he begins dictating the letter, he will erupt in a fit of coughing. As he coughs, a green smoke bomb will be set off in front of him. Once the smoke is heavy enough (npcs will enter though back door), Sam will collapse inside his robes with a shriek of pain, and the Dire Chaos Rats will emerge (ONE I EXPLODE FROM THE CORPSE... in unison) (Sound Effect- Rat squeaks after emerge)

  The Rats goal is to exit the storehouse and infect the nearby people, and secondly, fight and infect adventurers. They will take an erratic but steady route to the door, will attack if blocked or hindered, and exit. The NPCs are to go around the building, go out of game, and re-enter from the back door. They should gather at the robe pile . They are to wait until all the NPCs are back at the robes and then count again (ONE I EXPLODE FROM THE CORPSE... in unison) Continue until there have approximately 30 spawns. The mod marshal should keep a rough count of how may rats escape. If more than 15 rats escape, the module "The Plague is Upon You" can be ran.

  If a Rat downs a PC, they will infect them on the count of "I infect you one, I infect you two, I infect you three." The PC will then become Infected (see running notes).

rules_clarifications: 
craftsman_information: Scavenger- The smell of infection is heavy in the air. (the infection is represented by the hazy smoke.)
transformations: 
running_notes: Infection- Some creatures have the ability to infect helpless victims with material that will turn the person into a version of the creature. Unlike a werewolf or vampire curse, this is only a physical transformation of the victim’s body. Players will be told of specific triggers if necessary. Victims will lose all memory of their former lives, and the player must follow the commands they are given by the Monster Master until the character is slain. The character may then be killed and then given a Life spell and be cured of the infection. If the player dies the spirit may then proceed to the Healers’ Guild to be resurrected as normal. Infection is done just as a Killing Blow, with a count of “I infect you 1, I infect you 2, I infect you 3.”
