description: A random person brings a note into town, looking for friends of Sam Nekruv. The note begs for them to come at once, that the coughing is worse, and he is scared. Upon arrival, the adventures see Sam Nekruv, who is coughing worse than he did in town. He begs for them to not get too close. Eventually, his coughing will become worse and continuous. The scene will be then become enveloped by green smoke. Sam shrieks and falls to the floor, his cloak empty. Erupting from the once-body of Sam is a plague of Dire Chaos Rats.   

synopsis: |
  A person, Oh Aom, was passing by and was given a gold to deliver a note to the friends of Sam Nekruv in town, at the tavern. The deliverer, Oh Aom, seems sleazy, he just gives off those vibes. When/if asked for directions, he counters with an offer of the directions for a Platinum, two Platinum and he'll take them there, but he says he is willing to negotiate for less. He will cave if threatened or roughed up. If the PCs show up at the Mod Shack without directions, they will be instructed to find directions and come back. Oh will not go out of game until the directions are given or he takes them there.

  (ALTERNATE IF NO ONE BEFRIENDS SAM IN A WANDERING PLAGUE- A letter is delivered to the adventurers from the city of Vindale, requesting the adventurers look into a beggar in the warehouse district that was seen wandering around town. They are asked to investigate the beggar and see if a cure for his sickness can be found, or "another alternative sought if no cure is found". 

  Once the adventurers show up at the Inn, if they choose to enter the inn first, they will find it dimly lit, full of smoke from both the patron's pipes and a faulty fireplace, and smelling sour. The innkeeper will freely admit to letting a sick man stay in their storehouse for free because they felt bad for him. They will say that the storehouse is unlocked if the adventurers wish to go back there and they are free to do so. 

  When the adventurers chose to enter the storehouse, it is very hazy. The smell of infection is apparent to all that can smell the haze (i.e, you smell the fog, you smell the infection). If there happens to be a Scavenger in the group, they will almost be driven from the area by the smell of infection. The adventurers will be greeted by a coughing Sam at the very back of the storehouse (NPCs are outside the side door).
  
  Once he begins dictating the letter, he will erupt in a fit of coughing. As he continuously coughs, a green smoke bomb will be set off in front of him. Once the smoke is heavy enough, npcs will enter though back door hidden by the smoke. They need to try to be quiet so as not to alert the PCs. Sam will collapse inside his robes with a shriek of pain, and the Dire Chaos Rats will emerge (ONE I EXPLODE FROM THE CORPSE... in unison) (Sound Effect- Rat squeaks after emerge)

  The Rats goal is to exit the storehouse and infect the nearby people, and secondly, fight and infect adventurers. They will take an erratic but steady route to the door, will attack if blocked or hindered, and exit. The NPCs are to go around the building, go out of game, and re-enter from the back door. They need to gather at the robe pile for everyone to respawn. They are to wait until all the NPCs are back at the robes and then count again (ONE I EXPLODE FROM THE CORPSE... in unison) Continue until there have approximately 30 spawns. The mod marshal needs to keep a rough count of how may rats escape. If more than 15 rats escape, the module "The Plague is Upon You" can be ran.

  If a Rat downs a PC, they can bite and will infect them on the count of "I infect you one, I infect you two, I infect you three." The PC will then become Infected (see running notes).    

outcomes: Sam explodes into Dire Chaos Rats, unleashing a plague upon the land.
