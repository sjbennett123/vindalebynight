  Once the adventurers show up at the Inn. Velray Fisttoe, the innkeeper admits to letting a sick man stay in their storehouse for free because they felt bad for him. They will say that the storehouse is unlocked if the adventurers wish to go back there and they are free to do so. 

  In the Storehouse, the adventurers are greeted by Sam who is in back of the storehouse and coughing worse than was in town (NPCs for the Dire Rats are outside the side door). Sam begs for them to not get too close. He request that the players take down a letter to be delivered to his estranged Daughter Ruth, "Dear Ruth. I have not been the best (cough) father. But I want(cough) you (cough) (cough)". He then erupts in a fit of coughing. As he continuously coughs, a green smoke bomb is set off in front of him. Once the smoke is heavy enough, npcs enter though back door hidden by the smoke.

If they do do not use the smoke. Ask this at opening ceremonies if the event is small or ask on he way to the module if the event is larger.

They are asked to investigate the beggar and see if a cure for his sickness can be found, or "another alternative sought if no cure is found".
