introduction: You've gotten sicker and now you've sent word to those you met. You are sat at the very back of the storehouse of the Half Pony Inn. You will tell them to stay back in between coughs. You will be adamant that the PCs stay away, and will become agitated if approached. You will say that you want to dictate a letter to your daughter. You say that you don't have long, you can't breathe and you know there isn't any hope at this point. Nothing will change your mind, and you will insist between coughs that they need to send the letter. You can say that if you somehow survive, you will go see your daughter. You will become an adventurer like them. You will cough and wheeze and insist on the letter untill they agree.
