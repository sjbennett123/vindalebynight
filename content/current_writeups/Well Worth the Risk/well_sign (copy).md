Well-come' to the newly restored Vindale Spring! This spring was found when the city was newly built and was essential in the cultivation of the first grape vines in the area. Please, enjoy this piece of history and the healing properties it contains!

OOG- Actually drink from this fountain at your own risk! But if your character has 'drank from the spring' please stop by the Mod Shack for further instructions.
