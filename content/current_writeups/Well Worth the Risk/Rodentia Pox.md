Wear an out of game green bracelet that is visible to the Plot Team. If you are wearing a green bracelet, a plot member will ask about green pox makeup and if you wish to wear it.

You have been infected with Rodentia Pox. You must die and be lifed or resurrected for the Infection to be cured.

Your body is changing. Your senses are screaming with the flood of new sensations. Your body is confused, and is trying to purge the Pox by coughing up a thick, green mucus. You cough deeply and often, trying to dispel the mucus that has now set up residence in your lungs. 

You now crave the water from the well in town. You now have a burning desire to get people to drink from the well. You will use any means you think will work to get people to drink from the well.

You feel a deep kinship with the large black and green rodents and will not raise a weapon against them. You feel awful for the noble rats that now call the city home. You will not stand any harsh words against your rat brothers. You will defend them, even against your own,. In turn, the rats recognize you as rat kin, and will not bother or target you.
