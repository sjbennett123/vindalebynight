schedule: reaction
weight: 
plotline: Contagion
requirements: PC or NPC drinks from the well in town 

description: The well in town has been spelled. Townspeople have been seen drinking from it to get the benefits. Under the benign exterior lurks the corruption of Feihlen Brighthelm, beastmaster and mage. 

synopsis: | 
  There is a well near the tavern that has been spelled. Drinking from the well causes various effects (d10 effect chart).  Sometime after drinking from the well, for those that are wearing a green bracelet a green rash will appear and effect the hands, arms, neck, and face. 

  There is a sign on the well that says:
  'Well-come' to the newly restored Vindale Spring! This spring was found when the city was newly built and was essential in the cultivation of the first grape vines in the area. Please, enjoy this piece of history and the healing properties it contains![next line] 
  OOG- Actually drink from this fountain at your own risk! But if your character has 'drank from the spring' please stop by the Mod Shack for further instructions.
  
  The PCs that drink from the spring and want to participate in the plotline are directed to the mod shack. There, they will roll a D10, and will get the following effect per number: 1 Cure Mortal Wounds, 2 Cure Serious Wounds, 3 Regenerate, 4 Purify Blood, 5 - 10 Wear a green wristband - Rats no longer target you.
  
  If they get a green bracelet, they will be asked if they are ok with cream based makeup being applied on the hands, neck, face, or arms. If they consent, they will be given a green bracelet that will need to be displayed for easy visual. This bracelet is OUT OF GAME and is marked as such. This allows the NPC rats to avoid the marked PCs and also allows Plot to apply green makeup to marked PCs. They will also be instructed to cough randomly once the green makeup goes on.
  
  If someone who is Infected drinks from the well, they will not be affected by the well at all. They will not have to get a green bracelet.  If a detect magic is cast upon someone with a green bracelet or casts a detect magic on the well, it is detected.
