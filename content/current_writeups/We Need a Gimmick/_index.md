 **Brief**: A disheveled merchant comes to town after traveling to Vindale to sell wares. However, he was ambushed by Goblins and left in a ditch with only his clothes left.




 **Requirements:** Seven Souls has been Ran

 

**Synopsis**: A Goblin presence has re-emerged in Elysia, and they are up to all kinds of mischief. Mostly robbing merchants who travel alone or without security. They don’t kill the merchants, but they Waylay them and run of with their stuff. They work for someone, but it is unclear who organized them yet,

 

**Outcomes**: (1) The PCs go find the Goblins in an alley way not far from the tavern behind a Cabin and fight them for the merchants’ wares.

(2) The PCs kill the Goblins and keep all the loot, the merchant goes home broke

 

**Rumors:** “In the past, goblins were extremely prevalent almost everywhere you went, however, since the return of gatherings within the lands, there's been a distinct lack of their presence. However, most recently, there have been reports within Vindale of raiding parties attacking individuals, shipments, and merchants shops. All those who have made these reports claim that the goblins are extremely well organized. What is also very odd is that even those who have been attacked in these raids have been left mostly unharmed. However, all of their supplies, wares, and silver have been taken.
