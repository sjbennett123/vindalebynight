description: The les Sangsues Abyssale is in town, singing his own praises and trying to sell his dubious wares.

synopsis: Les Sangsues Abyssale (aka Frank Grisk) is in town. He is there to see how people like his wine, assure them that it is perfectly safe if questioned, to get adventurers to buy wine shares, toot his own horn on how good he is at making wine, how good of a mage he is and how his charms are perfect, etc. He has with him several 'charms', bobbles, trinkets, and 'potions'. None of these items actually have any effect. He is a smarmy car salesman out to make a buck.
