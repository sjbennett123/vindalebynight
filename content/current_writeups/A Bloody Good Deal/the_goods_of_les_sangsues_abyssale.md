A White Mask with Horns-
This mask was taken directly from the face of the body of Kargildan, an ancient figure that once ruled over this land. Kargildan was a mighty wizard, and bespelled his mask to protect it's wearer from any thrown potion, gas, or magic. Kargildan ruled the land with a powerful and hard fist, but was killed by choking on a cherry.

Wood Gourd Thing-
This was hand carved by dwarves that dwell in crystal caves far far away. They are supreme carvers of all materials, and their sculptures are something to behold. They are private with their carvings, and none have ever made it out of the caves. This piece was smuggled in the tail hair of one very hairy pony, and has been transferring hands ever sense. Les Sangsues Abyssale came to posses this one of a kind figure though a game of cards played with a rather unscrupulous art trader and his assistant. 

Gold beaded charm-
This one of a kind charm was taken from the hoard of a dragon. This hoard is the biggest that ever existed, and this charm is only one of very few pieces rescued from the gluttony of the dragon. This piece is hundreds of years old and elven make. Is said to shimmer under the light of a full solar eclipse.

Round Beaded Brownish Necklace-
These beads are made from the horn of a Chimera that was killed in a hunt by his Royal Highness Brallin Spiritriver. Brallin was a beloved leader who died in his attempt to kill the Chimera. He was successful, taking the beast with him in the bloody fight. Brallin was buried with beads, jewelry, gold, silver, and many items made from the body of the Chimera. His grave was found in 530, and the treasure unfortunately was dispersed.

Black Box-
No one knows what this item is. Is it a treasure box? Is it a token or carving of some kind? Is it magic? Is it something from another age? Whatever this object is, Abyssale went though a catacombs with many traps, spike pits, and ways to die. He was successful, and retrieved this object from deep within the catacombs. 

Gold Bell- 
This bell is said to summon a Unicorn that is sympathetic to those that rang the bell. The Unicorn will assist anyone who holds the bell with their desires. Unfortunately, the sequence of rings to summon the Unicorn has been lost to time.
