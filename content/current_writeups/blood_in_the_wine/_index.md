plotline: Corpseflower

description: A new drink is set up in the tavern. 

synopsis: |
  A new wine has been made by Frank (aka... les Sangsues Abyssale). The wine is a blood red thirst quencher and is being offered for free in the tavern. 

  PCs can choose to drink this wine and take a bracelet, granting them +2 damage per hand. They also contract Sangsues Fever. At night, their dreams are filled with blood.  Their veins are now very prominent, a bright red color and easy to see. There is a good chance that it will draw the wrong kind of attention from the local vampires. The PCs are having a horrible time trying to stay cool, having intense hot flashes and running a fever. 
  
outcomes: 
  - People drink the wine and are infected with the potent blood magic. 
  - People get mad at Frank and decide to rough him up in the module "We'll beat him bloody"
