synopsis: |
  A new drink is being served in Vindale! A blood red thirst quencher, it is being offered for free in the tavern. A new wine has been made by Frank, (aka... les Sangsues Abyssale), and given free to the adventurers. It is being served in the tavern for free for the entire weekend. It is fruity and bright red and cursed as hell. The wine was made with the aid of Blood Magic and will corrupt the drinker. On Saturday the module "Oops More Blood" details the horrible state of Frank's vineyards and if the players decide to get vengence for the horrible curse put upon them they can attack Frank in the reaction module "We'll beat him bloody".
