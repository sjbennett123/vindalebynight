title: Blood Wine Results
---
  You have partaken in the wine given by les Sangsues Abyssale and have contracted Sangsues Fever. There is no cure, the condition must be left to run it's course.

  At night, your dreams are filled with blood. Gushing, pulsing, flowing blood. What's worse, your veins are now very prominent, a bright red color and easy to see. There is a good chance that it will draw the wrong kind of attention from the local vampires.

 You feel a strength filling your body when you drink the wine. This wine allows you to swing faster and stronger than before! (+4 damage for two handed weapon, +2 damage per hand)

 However, you now are having a horrible time trying to stay cool. The hot flashes are almost unbearable in their intensity. You seem to be running a fever.
