\-    You are the hand of Death for the Mortal Vindale Courts. If it needs to die, you are the guy. If it needs to disappear, you are the guy. If you need information and its not giving it willingly, you are the guy.

\-    You are a very violent individual who has an addiction to Hallucinosis but when your adrenaline is flowing they donâ€™t affect you at all.

\-    You CANNOT stand Elves! Pompous, pretentious, self-righteous pricks! You mutter Knife Ear under your breath each time one walks by you. If you find them alone, you will slice their ears off and make them choke on them

\-    If someone upsets a court member or speaks negatively to them, all it takes is a look in the eyes from them to you and you will follow them into the darkness and kill them. You are ultra protective of all Court members. 

\-    You have a secret lust for Seraphine Belledona, the Harpy of Vindale but you like to watch her from a distance. If you have to kill everyone for one person, it would be her. But you just love murder so much it would be Monday for you.
