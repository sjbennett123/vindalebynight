\-    You are incredibly meticulous about Court Etiquette and Decorum. You aren’t afraid to invoke Laws of Elysium and remove violators of these rules while Court is in session.

\-    You are very quiet but quirky, you prefer to talk to a book or an animated creature with magic over people. You might be shy personally but when it comes to Court things, you are very vocal.

\-    You are absolutely disgusted and revolted by Scavangers, you relate them to literal animals, and they should be treated as such.

\-    Your word inside of Elysium is almost equal to the Prince’s word. Don’t be afraid to remind them who’s court they are in. 

\-    You absolutely LOVE the Vampires of Vindale, they are the best thing on Tyrra. Though you couldn’t bring yourself to become one when offered, you would gladly give your life to defend them as they defend you and Vindale.

\-    Laws of Elysium are as follows: 1) No weapons drawn in the Prince’s presence, 2) No combat of any kind during Court, 3) Tempers must be maintained at all times, 4) All grievances are to be left outside of Elysium, friend and foe alike
