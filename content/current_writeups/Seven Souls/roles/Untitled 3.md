\-    You are a very fierce warrior; in battle you get lost in a trance almost and don’t come out till your target is dead

\-    You get unreasonably upset when someone breaks the laws, they have drilled into your head

\-    You aren’t the biggest fan of the current Vampire Prince but he is a powerful protector so you respect that about him

\-    You don’t like Dwarves at all, cant trust them one bit, if they talk to you spit on the ground before them before you answer. They are too damn greedy and always get people in debts. One caused your old Deputies to die from betrayal.

\-    You will take “Bribes” to be convinced in and out of Crimes if the offer is good enough then drink a Forget Elixir to not know of it

\-    You wont let anyone get near Aliester Crom when you are around, you owe him that for your jobs duty but you don’t trust outsiders.

\-    Don’t be afraid to get in peoples faces if you are questioned or challenged, YOURE THE SHERIFF not them. Put them under arrest if they mad you mad or if they need a “cooling off” period in jail
