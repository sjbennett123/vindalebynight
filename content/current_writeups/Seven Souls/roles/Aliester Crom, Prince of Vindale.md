**Aliester Crom, Prince of Vindale**

*The Prince of Vindale in all mortal affairs and matters, but a servant of the Vampires till the end. Your life was almost over and meaningless till Lord Reyes saved you from Lycans one night. He couldn’t save your family, but he gave your life new purpose and showed that Vampires can be merciful after all. You see the best in the worst people, you might be a selfish narcissist monster inside but you like giving everyone a chance except Lycans…*

Motivations: Protection of Vindale and its Citizens, running of the Mortal Affairs in Vindale, upholding the Masquerade of Vindale for protection of the Courts

\-    Very loud and outspoken, your word is the law in Vindale only to be overruled by the Vampire Prince himself.

\-    You have a heavy hatred for Lycans, if players admit to you that they are Lycans then you will automatically distrust them.

\-    You are very sympathetic to ALL Vampire causes and demands.

\-    Impress upon the people that the Vindale Courts are for EVERYONES protection, monsters who protect us from other monsters.

\-    You will give people one warning if they interrupt you or cut you off. If you are treated rudely or in a negative way, they will be asked to take it back or be “Marked”

\-    Any sacrifice to be made to keep Vindale safe and the Vampires happy should be done

\-    When Court is in session you take absolute command and demand etiquette be followed

\-    Talk about the Harvester of Sorrows and how all must pay tribute to He
