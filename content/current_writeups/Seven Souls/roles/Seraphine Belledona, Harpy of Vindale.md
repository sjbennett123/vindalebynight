\-    You are THE center of gossip. You want everyone fawning and falling all over you. If you can rub a shoulder and whisper in an ear to get information you will. If someone wants to make a deal in exchange for juicy gossip and details, you will make it with arms wide open. Nothing is off limits in your line of work.

\-    You are very loud and flirtatious; you will get the room staring and talking. If they have something to say you will make their tongue spit it out. IF someone holds back saying something good or bad, you will become very frustrated with them and insult them till they say what they mean, even if it harsh and mean towards you its all about getting the information.

\-    You are absolutely disgusted by Hald-Orcs and Half-Ogres. They are vile creatures they belong in a gladiator pit or better off dead. They are ugly beyond repair and should be scourged from Tyrra to make it more beautiful.

\-    You play all the court against each other as your own sick personal game. You know Krimson Bloodstone, the Scourge of Vindale is absolutely obsessed with you. He is your attack dog; you will manipulate him relentlessly and lead him on to make his kill for your and torture for you. 

\-    The only thing about the Vampire you dislike is the fact they won’t embrace you. They keep telling that you are “too useful alive” but you suspect otherwise
