**Lucien Castiel, Seneschal of Vindale**

*The sharp and keen Seneschal of Vindale. The voice of the Courts in the absence of Prince Aleister Crom. From a young age you were obsessed with power and control. A member of the House of Bloody Shadows took interest in your local politician endeavors. Your keen sense of respect for how “things should be” and speaking for the absent with authority are admirable traits. You are soon in line for the Vampire’s Embrace if this next season goes well.*

\-    When the Prince Aleister Crom is not around, your word is LAW

\-    You are a very sharp knife, razor wit, and a very keen sense of “how things should be” If it were upto you, Vindale would be rules much tighter and more harshly as Vampire subjects should be managed

\-    You want to see all Gadabhari hung from a noose like the lawless thieves and traitors they are. Their kind bring nothing but trouble to our doorstep, you tolerate speaking to them but you would rather cut all their tongues out.

\-    You wish Prince Aleister would be more harsh on his subjects, he urges caution but you know the iron loyalty the House of Bloody Shadows demands too well

\-    The Vindale Vampires are the only thing that saved Vindale from ruin and the Bloody Fist during “The Vanishing” when the Crystal Barrier was raised. You will do anything to keep their will and dominion over Vindale, ever if that means slitting a few throats or burying a few bodies in the dead of night to keep it.
