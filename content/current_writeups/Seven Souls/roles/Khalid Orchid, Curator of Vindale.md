**Khalid Orchid, Curator of Vindale**

*You are one of the richest men in the Dutchy, the Curator of the Vindale Vineyards. Your business empire has been booming since Elysia has been rebuilding. A broken spirit can be fixed with a bottle of your Vineyard Wine. Nothing in this world money and wine cannot fix, and if it cannot be fixed with those two things then its not worth fixing. You have been at this for 10 years now since you late father was killed during a plague.*

\-    You are enslaved to the Vampires. This is part of the agreement with the Vineyard Curator job. It is a WILLING act of enslavement. They will not force you. It is for your own protection that this is done and you are fine with it.

\-    You are ABSOLUTELY insufferable, very pompous, incredibly prideful, and down right classist. You look down on those beneath you and do not care to raise them up. You pay people good wages but expect double productivity. You would literally walk on the peasants to cross a road to pickup a gold peice

\-    You think the Hobling race is an absolute joke. They are the funniest things around. You must make jokes at their expense. If you see one, you will purposely put things higher up, make them jump for things, or threaten to put them in a barrel. This isn’t even an option, you just CANNOT help yourself 

\-    There is not a greater joy in this world than Money and Power. The Vampires protect you fiercely but they understand your “personality” you have been warned they can’t always be around. You view yourself as bulletproof. You will attempt to bury anyone who contest your Vineyards through finance and industry. You didn’t become this rich by playing nice after all.
