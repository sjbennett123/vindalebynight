synopsis: Shortly after Army of the Night, the Seven Souls of Vindale approach the tavern. The current Seven Souls are the “Human” court of Vindale that run the town proper for the Vindale Vampires. They are all on board with the Vampires plans to keep Vindale safe, they run the day to day for the humans so they feel safer. The Vindale Vampires are smart and have faced the wrath of mass adventurers many times before, but this time a more “peaceful” agreement has kept them alive. The events of the last 4 years were very hard on the people of Vindale, their only saviors were the Vindale Vampires. Just when they believed all hope was lost during the time of the Bloody Fist rising, the Vampire emerged from the shadows and brutally out the Bloody Fist down. Rumor was they killed a previous general of the Bloody Fist and sent his head to the Warlord. A big focus of the council is to upkeep the “Masquerade” the Vindale Vampire have put in, the Masquerade is their system of laws and rules in exchange for security. The people of Vindale live a very good life for standards of the time, the wine flows, intellectual society flourishes in Vindale, a large focus on the Arts and Science of the land, and educated people make for a better world.
