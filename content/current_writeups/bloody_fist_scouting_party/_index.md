  Bloody Fist scouts are the youngest members of the bloody fist war machine.  They often do  not bring to bear the ferocity that one expects from the more seasoned Bloody Fist but rather they are willing to observe and plan. The Scouts will often leave the field of battle without ever engaging with an enemy in battle having gained knowledge to bring back to the horde with none the wiser.
