description: A report is delivered to the tavern “Large fast shadowy humanoid shapes with red markings have been sighted in the forest and are trying to capture citizens” this was a missive sent by the Bloody Shadow Attercob Assassins. When the adventurers arrive, it is a large barn very dimly lit. When they enter all the lights go out and red LED/ROPE Lights line the room as the only source of light…. Then the chittering begins…. The Attercob Assassins are hunting for worthy prey and will chase them all the way back to the edge of town but won't approach the tavern, but they will lurk outside waiting for victims.
