**Written by: Chris Colland**        **Reviewed by:** [Name]

**Requirements:** A Horrible Night to Have a Curse has been ran

 

**Synopsis**: The Bloody Shadow Attercob Assassins are hungry and they want blood to feast. A false missive has been sent by the Attercob via a charmed Vindale Guard. The PCs are given instructions that lead them to a barn outside of the central city proper, upon arrival, it is a large barn very dimly lit. When they enter all the lights go out and red LED/ROPE Lights line the room as the only source of light…. Then the chittering begins…. The Attercob Assassins are hunting for worthy prey and will chase them all the way back to the edge of town but won't approach the tavern, but they will lurk outside waiting for victims.

 

**Outcomes**: (1) The Bloody Shadow Attercob Assassins are defeated and they are gone for now…

(2) The Bloody Shadow Attercob Assassins pursue the fleeing PCS to the towns edge and then lurk in the darkness till they find a victim for 30 minutes after the module…

**Running Notes**: This module introduces one of the deadliest agents the Bloody Shadow House uses, the Attercob Assassin. This is a new breed of Attercob Vampiric Assassin hybrid. The PCs will enter the building and the Mod Shack to find all lighting go out except red lighting, then the chittering begins from the darkness. This was a brutal trap set to catch “dinner” and they will pursue back to the edge of town to lurk for 30 minutes. A module that becomes a random if you will depending on outcome.
