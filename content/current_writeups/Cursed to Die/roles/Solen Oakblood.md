**Soren Oakblood, Vindale Guard**

*You have served Vindale loyally for 5 years on its Guard, a retired adventurer turned local guardsman. This wasnâ€™t your first encounter with Vampires, but it was certainly your last. Your family is almost non-existent at this point so you have not much left to live for but gold and wine.*

Descriptive Phrase: Properly Repped

Body: 70 (30 Armor)

Defenses: Dodge x1, Resist Poison x3, Resist Sleep x3, Resist Charm x3, Resist Physical x1

Magic: None

Weapons: Sword

Damage: 15 Magic

Abilities: Slay/Parry x5

Transform: Curse of Transformation Vampire

Killing Blow Active: Only Monsters

Motivations: You have been bitten and cursed to die; this is your final adventure. You want to go out on your terms, not the terms of another. A stake would be dying like a Vampire, all you want to do is see the Sunrise one last time to cleanse your soul for death.
