Cursed to Die

 

**Written by: Chris Colland**        **Reviewed by:** [Name]

**Requirements:** What a Horrible Night to Have a Curse has been ran

 

**Synopsis**: Soren Oakblood doesn’t want to be cleansed and purified; he wants to meet the sunrise one last time. The adventurers have come to help after hearing about a Vampire attack from a rogue hive but it was a slaughter. When they arrive they find Solen laying on the floor crawling away from the remaining Vampires as they toy with him. Solen will talk the adventurers into leaving him a Circle of Power for the sunrise to claim him. He doesn’t want to die by stake cause he would die like “them” and purifying his spirit means removing his “failure” This is essentially assisted Suicide and he will leave the Adventures a note with a box of treasure he has if they accept his request. If the adventurers take the deal, Solen will die at Sunrise on Saturday, if they refuse it then Solen will kill himself in captivity and they will find a pile of ash on the Tavern porch with a note insulting them without the treasure.

 

**Outcomes**: (1) The PCs come to Soren’s aid and take his offer to let him die by the Sunrise, they receive his treasure chest like this

(2) The PCs deny him death by Sunrise, Soren’s ashes and a note are found on the Tavern Porch on Saturday morning scorning them for denying him an honorable death and reasonable request

 

**Rumors:** “A dark cloud begins to cover Woodhaven. The skies are overcast with a green hue. The flora is more vibrant and begins to glow in the moonlight.”

**Running Notes**: This module will offer an interesting situation to the PCS. Normally they are used to killing something infected or taking it to someone to be cured, but Soren does not want to be cured or saved. He wants to live with the shame of his failure and defeat. Soren will try anything he can to have the PCs leave him in his Circle of Power for the sunrise to claim him. This is the only happy solution for Soren, if they deny him this he will find a way to kill himself by morning and ashes will be found with a note insulting them and telling them the treasure is lost and given to people with “compassion in their hearts” A scout will arrive and lead them to the Manor House outside the city walls. When the PCs enter the Manor house, Soren will be crawling slowly for the door begging for death. Soren wont be able to help the PCs in this fight, he will be on the floor at 1 Body and Diseased. Once the Thralls are dealt with, Soren will begin trying to strike the deal. He will explain the story of how they got here fighting this rogue faction of Vampires, they have no connections to the Courts at all.
