description: Solen Oakblood seeks help in ending his vampyric life. 

synopsis:   a member of the Vindale Guard, Solen Oakblood, fight against the Vampires with his squadron and he was the lone survivor. He doesn’t know the Vampire who bit him but he is now Cursed to Die. He doesn’t want to be cleansed and purified, he wants to meet the sunrise one last time. The adventurers have come to help after hearing about a Vampire attack from a rogue hive but it was a slaughter. When they arrive they fight Solen laying on the floor crawling away from the remaining Vampires as they toy with him. Solen will talk the adventurers into leaving him a Circle of Power for the sunrise to claim him. He doesn’t want to die by stake cause he would die like “them” and purifying his spirit means removing his “failure” This is essentially assisted Suicide and he will leave the Adventures a 
outcomes: 
-  If the adventurers take the deal, Solen will die at Sunrise on Saturday and the adventurs get a note with a box of treasure he has if they accept his request. 
-  if they refuse it then Solen will kill himself in captivity and they will find a pile of ash on the Tavern porch with a note insulting them without the treasure.
