description: A vampire comes to town with information about a missing child. He tells the adventurers that he can lead them to the location where he knows the child is being kept. He will request an “escort” as the woods are unsafe currently. When the Vampire arrives, the unconscious body of the missing child will be laying in the woods, the Vampire will look over his shoulder and smirk saying “….And this is the part where you run for your lives…..” as he laughed and turns to mist. From the Darkness, Vampires rush the adventurers trying to slay them all.
