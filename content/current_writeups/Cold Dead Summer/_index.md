synopsis: Cassius, a vampire comes to town with information about a missing child. He tells the adventurers that he can lead them to the location where he knows the child is being kept. He will request an “escort” as the woods are unsafe currently. When they arrive with the Vampire, the unconscious body of the missing child will be laying in the woods, the Vampire will look over his shoulder and smirk saying “….And this is the part where you run for your lives…..” as he laughs and turns to mist. From the Darkness, Vampires rush the adventurers trying to slay them all.
outcomes: 
  - The PCs recuse the missing child and fight off the vampires, once returned to town the father will bring them a reward to the tavern.
  - The PCs escape the vampires or fall fighting them, if the child it not rescued he will become a Vampire under a CoT and kill his family resulting in their deaths and not the full module treasure.

running_notes: This module is the final module of the weekend. The PCs will either save a missing child and receive a nice treasure box or he will be lost and the child will wake up later and go insane under his new affliction. When the PCs are led to the spot, they will be ambushed by a horde of Vampire awaiting them. Cassius was actually helping them before he vanished. Sensing the impending doom, the Blackthorne’s summoned the spirit energy to invoke the PCs transforms for one last hellish battle for Vindale for the gather.
