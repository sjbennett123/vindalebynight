schedule: saturday
weight: 
plotline: The Tarrasch
requirements: Ran directly after Tarrasch-ing Through the Woods (or sometime after A Tarrasch Party if TTTW is not ran)

description: As the adventurers close in on the end of the trail, the Tarrasch are seen in camp, on high alert. The adventurers must approach unheard and unseen in order to ambush the Tarrasch assassins, or if ambush proves impossible, obtain the assassination order by what ever means necessary.  

synopsis: |
  After the Tarrasch assassination group left Vindale, they were forced to make camp as the Market Day has riled up the countryside and cross country isn't safe. They are camped at the edge of the woods at the end of the trail. When the adventurers approach the camp, they will find the Tarrasch on alert, scanning the area. The Tarrasch pawns should walk around, sit, talk, but keep their weapons in hand. The leader, the Black Rook Krath Stormwell, has on him a letter sent to him with a broken wax seal, a black rook chess piece, and a Tarrasch symbol necklace. He should be standing away from the woods, watching the side away from the woods. The Pawns are all tattood and some have a black chess piece, and will give it up when searched (if more than one spawn per NPC is needed, the last Black Tarrasch Pawn to spawn will give it). 
  
  The note reads, "The Crinamorte, friday night" Signed with the Tarrasch symbol and the letter B.
  
  If anyone sees or hear a PC approach, they are to sound the alarm ("To the rear! To the right! etc...) and group together. Krath Stormwell should be in the center of the group as their healer. Diplomacy, attack, bluff, whatever they do, it's up to the adventurers. The Tarrasch group should try to gather away from the woods if possible, for safety of everyone, Out of Game.
  
  If the fight looks like it is going to go the adventurers way, Krath should try to escape. This mod should be set up a bit away from the mod shack to allow adequate chase time before Krath goes out of game for this reason. If distance is not able to be used/or the level of difficulty altered, Krath can stay In Game and able to be tracked the same way he was before. This time the "trail is fresh" and leads right to him (A Rook Fight).

  - The PCs are able to kill/capture Krath Stormwell, obtain the assassination note, and bring proof back to Dyinn Vintrel
  - The PCs do not obtain proof and lose their gold/items until the market is over
