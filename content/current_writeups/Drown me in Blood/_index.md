synopsis: The Hate Beast, a beast driven entirely by pure hatred, is unknown in origin of its creator. Best guess is a House of Sanguinus Nocturna experiment gone wrong but not even the Vampires have claimed him yet. The creature has been seen sprinting through the woods seeking anything it can find to slaughter and consume the hatred of. A Vindale Guard scout managed to stay hidden from it and see the Beast in action to confirm it was him. Now he seeks brave adventurers to help kill it.

 
outcomes: 
  - The PCs aid the Vindale Guard in helping slay the Hate Beast
  - The PCs decline the request and the Hate Beast becomes a roaming monster till killed
