title: The Tarrasch
---
The Bishop has learned that those he toyed with in Stonewood will be at the market for Vindale. He decides to use the situation to take care of the adventurers. In order to do that, they will make use and kill some soft vampires that advocate for ethical treatment of their food. The Bishop made his case to the King, and the King agreed. He sent in Krath Stormwell, the Black Rook and a whole contingent of trained Black Pawn Fighters to take out Aldreik and Eslendra Crinamorte. They picked these vampires because they would be the most trusting given their strange beliefs of humane and consesual use of the living as food, and also because of said beliefs. Krath and company killed the Crinamortes and set the adventurers up to be arrested. The adventurers must talk to and convince Captain Vintrel of their innocence. If they succeed, they are tasked with bringing back proof. They meet the Rook and his Pawns. The Rook carries the proof. After they defeat the Rook and prove their innocence, Captain Vintrel will offer the help of the vampires in tracking down the Bishop.
