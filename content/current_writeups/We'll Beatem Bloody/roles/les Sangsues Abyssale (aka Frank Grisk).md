introduction: |

  les Sangsues Abyssale (pronounced less Sang-suss Abby-sale, literally the abysmal leech) is a man out for a buck. Always looking for the next big thing, the next money maker, the next scheme. You are coming into town to make sure everyone liked your wine, and of course, sell your charms, bobbles, trinkets, and potions. You have no idea what your name means. You heard someone call you that one day, and you liked it so much you adopted the name.

  This character is based off of the cliche of a smooth talking car salesman.
