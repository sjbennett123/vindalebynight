schedule: saturday
weight: 
plotline: The Tarrasch
requirements: A Tarrasch Party ran

description: An interactive tracking module that is optional to be ran depending on available PC skills. This is direct lead into "Proof is in the Tarrasch". 

synopsis: |
  A trail has been laid using bright colored squares of cardstock. When the PCs decide to track the assassins, a square of colored paper is given to the tracker. It is explained to the tracker that they will need to find (or alternately taken to) a matching square to start the trail. They are told to follow the trail of squares through the woods to the beginning of the mod. They are In Game the entire time. The squares are Out Of Game, and represent trail marks and/or scent.
  
  Standing at the first square, the second square should be able to be seen, and then followed to that location. The third square is visible from the second, and so on and so forth until they get to the end, where the Tarrasch are waiting. 
  
  If the tracker from the city is used, he needs to make sure to say something to the effect of "If you need anymore of my help, I can be found at the guard house" before starting the track, in case he dies.  
  
  Alternatively to the PCs coming to the Mod Shack on Saturday, the Zal Crowgem, the Vindale City tracker can go and get the group on Saturday. Also, the interactive aspect can be forgone and the tracker lead the PC group to the Tarrasch directly.
  
  If Zal dies, he will resurrect at the guard shack (mod shack). If Krath gets away, and Zal dies, he will return to the PC group and offer to track him (he says, to the effect of "the trail is fresh, and we must go!" when he returns)
  
outcomes: The PCs track the Tarrasch assassins to their camp
