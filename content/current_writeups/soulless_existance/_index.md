### The Heist

Horatio stole a magical book,  "The Book of Invitations" from the private library of Lucen the Senechel of Vinale. The theft went out without a problem Lucien has still not noticed that his book is missing and will only notice this midday on saturday. Sadly when the theft was completed it brought the book out of the protective vault that it is normally kept in this alerted the forces of Haskell the time lord that this thing needed to be eliminated. Haskell's imprionment is a tale for another day but his operation operates well enough without his involvement and a swarm of these beasts began to hunt down the Book 

### Luke's Wall

Horatio realized that he was about to be overwhelmed and enacted a ritual to buy him time. He is hoping that one of his allies would arrive and rescue him. Sadly they are not aware that he is in this predicament so he is going to die in this clocktower This ritual slowed all of the time around him by consuming the time that was in his very heart. There are many ways to circumvent this ritual but none that the clockwork golems could manage. 

- One could use a Destroy Formal Magic ritual against the barrier but that is made difficult by the roaming golems.
- One could obtain a Copper Key that is guarded in the Demi Plane of Nightmare. This would provide a bubble that barrier cannot touch. 
- One could simply wait for Horatio to run out of time then the ritual will end and the golems will rend him head to toe.
