Hoylean Marauder

 

*You are soldier in the Hoylean military, your purpose is glorious reclaiming of the Light and vanquishing of the Darkness. You have been hunting the Murumbrians for ages now. All roads to this timeline flow through Woodhaven. Hoyale is your home, but Vindale is the where the veil is thinnest currently. You came to Vindale in search of replenishment, Murumbrians have been on your trail for days now and you need to recover.*

 

 

-Unlike your Murumbrian enemies, you have feet but the flow of time in this transformed state has prevented you from quick movement. You walk at a steady pace and will not increase since Time is warped around you

\- Your main goal is to complete the “Offering of Light” while in Vindale as this is where the veil is thinnest currently. The “Offering of Light” will restore your squadron to full power as the Murumbrians are hunting you.

-Warn them that helping them might bring danger to Vindale but they will do their best to protect them. If pressed about the danger, tell them Murumbrians are actively hunting them as they killed a high ranking Murumbrian recently.

-Move very robotic. Make your body turns and head movements very slow and robotic while you are patrolling. Speak with authority, you are righteous crusaders of the winning side of a war.
