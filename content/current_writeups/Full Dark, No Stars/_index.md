synopsis: A band of Hoyleans Warriors come to town demanding “The Sacrifice of Light” be completed before dawn or there will be a terrible anomaly released upon Vindale. Depending on how the Adventurers act towards The Hoyleans, they will be approached by an Agent of the Vindale Vampires to help “deal” with them. If they take the deal, the Adventurers will be granted a temporary Darkness Aura on their weapons to attack the Hoyleans, this will lead to a possibility of a Murumbrian appearing. If the Adventurers decline the deal and work with the Hoyleans, they will be granted a Once Ever invocation of a Light Aura for the next 2 days. This module is the precursor to Soulless Existence
outcomes: 
  -  The PCs take the offering of Light and empower the Relic the Hoyleans carry.
  - The PCs take the offer of the Vindale Agent and attack the Hoyleans, unknown to them this could draw a small battle with a Murumbrian in the near future.

running_notes: This module is a town wide encounter that brings an interesting choice to them. They will likely take time questioning the Hoyleans as to why they are there. During this time, Shade the Agent of Night will appear and make a deal that if they get rid of the Hoyleans, not only will they the means to do so, but a minor boon to Shade whom works for the Vindale Courts. This will essentially give the PCs a “in” with the Courts by doing small deeds and tasks for Shade
