synopsis: A band of Hoyleans Warriors come to town demanding “The Sacrifice of Light” be completed before dawn or there will be a terrible anomaly released upon Vindale. Depending on how the Adventurers act towards The Hoyleans, they will be approached by an Agent of the Vindale Vampires to help “deal” with them. If they take the deal, the Adventurers will be granted a temporary Darkness Aura on their weapons to attack the Hoyleans, this will lead to a possibility of a Murumbrian appearing. If the Adventurers decline the deal and work with the Hoyleans, they will be granted a Once Ever invocation of a Light Aura for the next 2 days. This module is the precursor to Soulless Existence
