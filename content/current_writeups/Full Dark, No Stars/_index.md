Full Dark No Stars

Full Dark, No Stars

 

**Written by: Chris Colland**        **Reviewed by:** [Name] 
 
**Brief**: A band of Hoyleans Warriors come to town demanding “The Sacrifice of Light” be completed before dawn or there will be a terrible anomaly released upon Vindale. 
**Requirements:** Cursed to Die has been ran

 

**Synopsis**: The Offering of Light is a time honored of the Hoyleans who appear at different times in Vindale. Depending on how the Adventurers act towards The Hoyleans, they will be approached by an Agent of the Vindale Vampires to help “deal” with them. If they take the deal, the Adventurers will be granted a temporary Darkness Aura on their weapons to attack the Hoyleans, this will lead to a possibility of a Murumbrian appearing. If the Adventurers decline the deal and work with the Hoyleans, they will be granted a Once Ever invocation of a Light Aura for the next 2 days. This module is the precursor to Soulless Existence

 

**Outcomes**: (1) The PCs take the offering of Light and empower the Relic the Hoyleans carry

(2) The PCs take the offer of the Vindale Agent and attack the Hoyleans, unknown to them this could draw a small battle with a Murumbrian in the near future

 

**Rumors:** “Time in Vindale has been seeming to pass slightly differently. The Night seems longer and the Day shorter. Minutes seems like hours; seconds seem like minutes.” 
**Hook**: a group of Hoyleans wander into town seeking the Offering of Light

**Number of Cast Members**: 6

**Roles**: Hoylean Marauder x5, Agent of Night “Shade”

**Props**: “Offering of Light” object, White Tabards for Hoyleans, PC clothing for Agent

**Scene 1**: (OOG) Town/Tavern (IG) Burning Goblet Tavern

**Flee Point**: Town/Site Wide

**Non-Standard Effects**: None

**Rules Clarifications**: None

**Craftsman Information**: None

**Transformations:** Light and Darkness Elementals

**Running Notes**: This module is a town wide encounter that brings an interesting choice to them. They will likely take time questioning the Hoyleans as to why they are there. During this time, Shade the Agent of Night will appear and make a deal that if they get rid of the Hoyleans, not only will they the means to do so, but a minor boon to Shade whom works for the Vindale Courts. This will essentially give the PCs a “in” with the Courts by doing small deeds and tasks for Shade

Hoylean Marauder

 

*You are soldier in the Hoylean military, your purpose is glorious reclaiming of the Light and vanquishing of the Darkness. You have been hunting the Murumbrians for ages now. All roads to this timeline flow through Woodhaven. Hoyale is your home, but Vindale is the where the veil is thinnest currently. You came to Vindale in search of replenishment, Murumbrians have been on your trail for days now and you need to recover.*

 

 

-Unlike your Murumbrian enemies, you have feet but the flow of time in this transformed state has prevented you from quick movement. You walk at a steady pace and will not increase since Time is warped around you

\- Your main goal is to complete the “Offering of Light” while in Vindale as this is where the veil is thinnest currently. The “Offering of Light” will restore your squadron to full power as the Murumbrians are hunting you.

-Warn them that helping them might bring danger to Vindale but they will do their best to protect them. If pressed about the danger, tell them Murumbrians are actively hunting them as they killed a high ranking Murumbrian recently.

-Move very robotic. Make your body turns and head movements very slow and robotic while you are patrolling. Speak with authority, you are righteous crusaders of the winning side of a war.
