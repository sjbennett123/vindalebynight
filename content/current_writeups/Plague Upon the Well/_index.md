weight: 
plotline: Contagion
requirements: PCs cast purify well on the spring AFTER It's a Plague, My Deer.

description: People have been showing up with alarming symptoms. When investigated, the spring is found to be the common thread.

synopsis: |
  When the symptoms start showing up for those who drank, and the three afflicted the worst have come into the tavern, one common thread is discovered. Everyone drank from the spring in town.
  
  If detect formal magic or detect magic, it is detected. The Cure Light Wounds healing spell.

  To cure the green plague, the spring needs to have a purify well cast on it after the big well is destroyed in 'It's a Plague, My Deer'. If Purify Well is cast on the spring before the big tainted well, it will just be ineffective (The spell was successful for a few seconds! And then the well became tainted once again.) On Brighthelm will send all of his creatures to defend the well while the spell is being cast. If the spell is successful, all well effects will be removed, and all OOG green bracelets need to be removed. All makeup can be removed at this time.

  (If the well is not purified by the end of the event, the City will cast their own purify well spell and end the green plague before everyone leaves. They will do it unhindered and be successful.)
    
outcomes: 
  - The well spring is purified of all effects during the event
  - The well spring isn't purified until the end of the event
