**Grim, the Gravekeeper of Vindale**

*You are an avatar of Death in Elysia. You serve the Graveyards directly with no higher master. You are aware of the Vampire problem Vindale faces but you have been ordered to tend the dead while others reap the dead. You don’t remember anything of your life before death, but in death your spirit has become a powerful Guardian of Vinadle. Ever the Vindale Vampires fear and respect your role in the cosmology of things.*

\-    Grim is a Spirit of Death. Not THE spirit of Death but a Spirit of Death.

\-    Grim can cast any Formal Magic related to the Death Plane (Gate, Asylum, Summon, Etc) at Will

\-    While being a Spirit of Death, Grim is very much alive with a metabolism but due to his “Blessing” he is immune to most status effects.

\-    Grim can Renew a person’s skills if an Offering is made to Death. The offering is typically a life for a life, but anything of major sacrifice that would please Death and the Graveyards would suffice. If Grim does this for a person, they are drained of their emotions till the next sunrise as a result of the overwhelming Death energy used to power this magic. 

\-    As a Spirit of Death, all Undead will see you as the literal Grim Reaper and recoil in fear from you. Even the Vampire Princes of Vindale are affected.

\-    Any weapon Grim uses to Killing Blow any Undead will act as a Stake of Woe
