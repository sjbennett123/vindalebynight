 **Running Notes**: This module reveals how little people know about dealing with plagues in a medieval society. The family put these children to “rest” when they contracted a plague and died, or so they thought. There was a plague 20 years ago in Vindale but these children were infected with Vampirism. Now they have awoken from their torpor sleep and are in blood frenzy. When enter the vampires are staring into different corners of the room and all turn around at once and hiss as they attack.
