les_sangsues_abyssale has been using Blood Magic to augment his winemaking and it makes a delicious wine! This wine while tasty has some minor side effects where it causes those that drink it to dream of the gushing of blood. 

Sadly this wonderful wine with only a few small problems was too good to last and the whole blood magic thing has corrupted his vineyards. He realizes the extent of this midway through the event as he is packing up the wine to deliver the town. He then needs to get the players to burn the corrupted vines. 

The players may at some point be frustrated with him for offering the wine that corrupts thier thoughts and dreams. That seems like overreacting to me but who am I to judge.
