description: A scout reports an indestructible altar in the forest with 7 slots for what look to be small statues to be placed. 
synopsis: These statues are what some Of the Gargoyles of Nights Stone drop when killed. Once they have 7 they can place them in the Altar and the Gargoyles will stop attacking the area freely. This module begins with a few waves of Randoms and the dropping of the first Statue, Until the Altar is “disabled” the Gargoyles will spawn occasionally and come hunting the remaining pieces to reclaim them. The Gargoyles will spawn every hour on the hour until they are “disabled”
outcomes: 
  - The PCs fight the Gargoyles of Nights Stone until they collect the statues and disable to Altar to end the hourly spawning
  - The PCs don’t stop the Altar and they must deal with the Gargoyles on the hour all day and night

rumors: Statues around town have been vanishing and reappearing in new locations. No rhyme or reason to the movements or who is doing this. Very odd that it just started now and there is no evidence to how it is happening.

hook: A Vindale Guard comes to town with a report of this indestructible altar in the woods with 7 places for something to set in them

    flee_point: Mod Shack Door (NPCs will pursue)

running_notes: This module introduces a reoccurring random for the day till it is solved. The PCs will think they are going to be found differently but on each way of randoms a Gargoyle will drop 1 of the mini resin statues they need. If they do it the normal way, it will take 7 randoms. If they discover the button on the box, this will accelerate the Gargoyles spawn so it can be completed quicker. There will be a hint given by the Vindale Guard. This goes from randoms to a module to randoms back to solved with the players being able to keep the statues when they magic is drained from them.
