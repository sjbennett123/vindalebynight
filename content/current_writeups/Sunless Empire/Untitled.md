Sunless Empire: A scout reports an indestructible altar in the forest with 7 slots for what look to be small statues to be placed. These statues are what some Of the Gargoyles of Nights Stone drop when killed. Once they have 7 they can place them in the Altar and the Gargoyles will stop attacking the area freely. This module begins with a few waves of Randoms and the dropping of the first Statue, Until the Altar is “disabled” the Gargoyles will spawn occasionally and come hunting the remaining pieces to reclaim them.
