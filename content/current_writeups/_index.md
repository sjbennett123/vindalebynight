  Regular reports from Moutesque have been very vague and scattered over the last 3 years. The last letter received was dated in February of 623 (about 4 months ago). Now a distress call has been sent out to the Ducal Watchtowers to send aid that Moutesque has went silent. People suspect Valdrick has his hand in the game but other rumors are the Feral Werewolves of Cryptinth have found a way to compromise the balance of power between Cryptinth and Moutesque.

    Hail good heroes of Elysia! My name is Kyumiri Cryptinith, the Lord Reeve of Cryptinith, servant of the former Duke Ryldinmar of Elysia. These past 3 years have been hard on us all, but we in Cryptinith have endured the storm. I’m sure you all are aware of the city of Moutesque and that the Dark Tower holds. A troubling omen indeed, it has been 3 months since the last report had arrived on my desk from the order of mages who guard the tower. The Cryptinith family have been charged with overseeing the Dark Tower and it’s surroundings should the Order of Oblivions Edge go silent. 
    
    This is a call for aid to the Heroes or Elysia! Something sinister is afoot in the shadows of Moutesque. We have our own share of problems with the Feral lurking in the forests outside of Cryptinith. STICK TO THE ROADS ON YOUR WAY HERE AND DO NOT TRAVEL AT NIGHT ALONE!!! Make sure you bring Silver weapons….. but please do not carry them openly in the city walls of Cryptinith. I shall post the laws of our city very soon. This expeditionary force will rendezvous ￼on the 2nd of June 623. You may use our city of Cryptinith as your forward base as the city of Moutesque is not habitable to anyone besides the mages of Obilvions Edge.
    
    The rumors from Moutesque have been Valdrick's forces have invaded but I have not seen any signs of full invasion yet. Another rumor we have been investigating are the Feral have been working with an unknown force to compromise the balance between Moutesque and Cryptinith.
    
    I wish you all safe travels and look forward to meeting all of you in the coming week!
    
    ~Kyumiri Cryptinith
    High Lord Reeve of Cryptinith
    Adopted son of former Duke Ryldinmar
    Warden of Hakken’s Blade
    Defender of Cryptinith

## The Vampire Clans

3 Clans of Vampire Nobilty rule Vindale Keep and the surrounding villages:

**House of Bloody Shadows** (Beautiful Powerful Shadow wielding warriors and dominant leaders, very persuasive, diplomatic, but terrifying in battle with weaponry)

**House of Sanguinus Nocturna** (Blood Sorcerers and Experimenters of Vampiric Alchemy and Flesh abominations)

**House of Feral Howls** (Traditional “Vampire” stereotypes of very animalistic claws and deformed visages, control over the creatures of the night and woods)

3 Clans of Vampire Commoners the serve the Noble Houses of Vindale

**Clan of Creeping Death** (Vampire assassins, capture and eliminate threats for the nobility for gold and favors, tend to be very sloppy eaters and leave victims to die)

**Clan of Deranged Nightmares** (Vampire saboteurs, will enter a village and ravage resources and drive the villagers made from fear before the nobility arrives, but they are highly unstable and tend be very violent when challenged)

 **Clan of Shattered Bone** (Vampire shock troops, absolute brutes and very hard to control, tend to lash out when you tell them what to do without a way to calm them down)

Vindale once lived in peace from Vampire threat many years ago but under a blood moon, 3 Siblings were taken from a noble family in exchange for a debt paid off. The 3 siblings were captured by a small band of Vampires, the 6 founders of the Houses and Clans of the future Court of Vindale.

### House of Bloody Shadows 

is led by Lord Alvaro Balduino de-los-Reyes (Lord Reyes informally, his full name on written documents and for deals being struck), a former warrior king of a lost noble family. A charm tyrant but can be reasoned with diplomatically. Loves to trade boons and favors in a court setting. Would prefer to make a deal and win the battle without stepping foot on the field, but if enraged Reyes will take up his sword and show zero mercy to his foes or those who have slighted him. If you do not agree with him or submit to his will he will Dominate you to bow or enslave you to do his work un-willingly. He is the current Prince of the Vindale Court

House of Sanguinus Nocturna is led by Lord Magnus Erebus, a powerful magic scholar who devoted his studies in life to advanced formal celestial magic, in death he has become more  favorited with Necromancy research and rituals to create new breeds of undead abomination, his prowess as a Celestial wizard has never been questioned as he will openly challenge people to magical duels if they question him.

### House of Feral Howls 

is led by one only known as “Ravenlord”, In life Samiel Walker was a humble farmer and hunter for his king with an affinity for wild animals. When he was embraced to the night, he was left for dead in the forest by his Sire. The only creatures to hear his cries for help were an Unkindness of Ravens in the Vindale woods. They came and drank of his blood and became empowered by the essence of Darkness itself. They carried him to safety where Sameul began his undeath as in a cavern. Over time he has mastered the power of the corrupted animals of Vindale’s wilderness. He is always companied by a swarm of humanoid Ravens while will viciously defend him and attack on his command. 

 Clan of Creeping Death is led by Khaldun Amaranth, in life Khaldun was a murderer and rogue to a deadly band of assassins. His throat was slit upon his embrace so he does not speak normally, his only means of communication is telepathy. He is very cold and calculating. He does not make deals. He will complete the contract at all costs. He will kill anyone who gets between him and his prey. He normally walks alone at night but on missions he is accompanied by a group of elite 

Rogues who ensure no witnesses or survivors are left. Clan of Deranged Nightmares is led by Zelos Arentis, A man of sick and twisted faith in life. 

Deranged from a young age and spoke with spirits who were never there to others but him. He trains his clan to inflict pain and misery on those who defy the masters of Vindale. He carries the preserved dead rabbit he had as a childhood pet on him (a magic item) as a means to communicate with the spirits whom arent seen. He might seem almost normal for a moment with his humor but don’t turn his back or his sinister nature will just get your throat slit while he smiles. Zelos summons Nightmare elementals when he is attack or feels fear cause his repressed child mentality can only be comforted by the Nightmares of Vindale.

###  Clan of the Shattered Bone 

is led by Mortimer Cerdic, a violent and brutal barbarian who ravaged the countryside in life for fun. The Tribe of Shattered Bone was known for its brutality and not even leaving a building standing in its wake. They would burn the building with you barricaded inside and slaughter who ran out like a game. If you draw a sword in their presence they will begin to attack. Raising your voice at them will just draw their attention to you. 

Mortimier likes to collect the heads of his victims, specifically the leaders/nobility in places they have conquered. Accompanied by an entourage of bloodthirsty savages who only wants your blood and heart

-Vindale Module Outline-

Friday Night

Into the Everblack: The game opens with the players coming into town, along the road are blue/purple torches and Orc heads impaled on spikes. Standing infront of the Tavern is a member of the Blackthorn hunter family cloaked in black hiding their face handing out the “Blackthorne’s Guide to Surviving Vindale” to the new coming adventurers. The cloaked information vendor will tell them that new adventures haven’t been to Vindale in 3 years now

Army of the Night: Shortly after the adventurers reach the City of Vindale and enter the Tavern. A swarm of Wolves of the Feral Hunt and Bats of Sanguine Reaping descend on the town of Vindale. Their numbers seem vast and relentless, after some time they will pull back once they have tested these new adventurers. 

Saturday Morning

Saturday Early Afternoon

Saturday Evening

Saturday Night

:::Anytime:::

Drown me in Blood: The Hate Beast, a beast driven entirely by pure hatred, Must be killing blowed under the effects of a Berserk effect, the killing blow will consume the Berserk from the killing person. It creature is not killed while under effect of a Berserk, it will revive/renew in 60 seconds. If no Berserk elixir is present, you can drink the blood of the Hate Beast (5 count) 

Cold Dead Summer: A vampire comes to town with information about a missing child. He tells the adventurers that he can lead them to the location where he knows the child is being kept. He will request an “escort” as the woods are unsafe currently. When the Vampire arrives, the unconscious body of the missing child will be laying in the woods, the Vampire will look over his shoulder and smirk saying “….And this is the part where you run for your lives…..” as he laughed and turns to mist. From the Darkness, Vampires rush the adventurers trying to slay them all.

Corpseflower: A concerned citizen comes to town with information about the Rotting Sanguine Vines. A failed attempt at cheaply replicating Vindale Wine mixed with blood magick has lead to the corruption and animation of the vines beneath the soil in Vindale, now the adventurers must go and torch the failed Vineyard and creatures the vines have infected.

Everything Went Black: A report is delivered to the tavern “Large fast shadowy humanoid shapes with red markings have been sighted in the forest and are trying to capture citizens” this was a missive sent by the Bloody Shadow Attercob Assassins. When the adventurers arrive, it is a large barn very dimly lit. When they enter all the lights go out and red LED/ROPE Lights line the room as the only source of light…. Then the chittering begins…. The Attercob Assassins are hunting for worthy prey and will chase them all the way back to the edge of town but won't approach the tavern, but they will lurk outside waiting for victims.

Sunless Empire: A scout reports an indestructible altar in the forest with 7 slots for what look to be small statues to be placed. These statues are what some Of the Gargoyles of Nights Stone drop when killed. Once they have 7 they can place them in the Altar and the Gargoyles will stop attacking the area freely. This module begins with a few waves of Randoms and the dropping of the first Statue, Until the Altar is “disabled” the Gargoyles will spawn occasionally and come hunting the remaining pieces to reclaim them.

You Will Know the Lion by his Claw: A Forest Crypt is guarded by mysterious Marble Lion Statues. They seem to have been here for a long time at this point but pristine in upkeep. They belonged to the Lionheart of the pre-adventuring days of Vindale. Lord Lionheart was a renowned sculptor. In secret he made these to defend his families Crypt and underground complex. Lord Lionheart was bitten by a Vampire and turned, but he did not suv on to the bloodlust like the Vindale Vampires did. He lived out his days turning his beautiful statues into weapons of war. They were modeled after Diamond Golems but he believed Marble to be the superior Material for the ultimate weapon. In the depths of the Crypt is a very old Lord Lionheart who will attempt to barter a deal to be left alone with a chest of treasure should they give him a chance to make this deal. He will tell them that his original blueprints were taken by the Vindale Vampires so he can only make them from memory but they aren’t perfect like they once were. They Vindale Vampires orchestrated this hit on Lord Lionheart to remove him from the opposing side since he was so adamantly against them.

Death Magick for Adepts: Sent from the hall of the Shattered Bone Clan of Vampires, the Shattered Bonebreakers have begun a cull on a small village just east of Vindale. These troopers are typically sent in as shocktroops before the grand assault by the Vindale Vampires commences. The Village was known to be harboring Various Lycans who were hiding from the Vindale Vampires. It is law in Vindale that if you are openly transformed into your Lycan war form that you are allowed to be slain in the streets, Lycans have been deemed too dangerous to trust when in their war form. A message is delivered from an animal to the Adventurers via the Blackthorne Hunter Family, directions are provided but they will warn them about the Bonebreakers savagery.

Funeral Thirst: The House of Sanguinius Nocturna are obsessed with Alchemical and perfection of the Flesh. Sanguinus Flesh Beast have been their greatest creation in recent memory, but they require fresh flesh once a year like the Vampires require Blood to survive. They have been stalking the woods seeking fresh flesh to consume to sustain themselves but they have not been as lucky in their harvest. As a result they have become desperate and begun digging up a public Graveyard in the forest. At this point dead flesh is better than nothing, it is the equivalent to a Vampire drinking Animal blood when Feral and on the verge of Bloodlust. This was observed by a merchant on the road and he comes to town quickly and out of breath absolutely horrified that he saw these Flesh Beasts eating corpses.

Nightbringers: 

Widowmaker:

Blood and Fire: This module is 3 part, it starts with a invasion of Blood Golems as randoms, a follow up wave of Golems with a note found on one of the Golems with a “drop point” and becomes a raid on a storehouse containing the last Blood Golems sent out, a burnt note is found at the last place with the words “Thanks for your support and gold ~TG” The Blood Golems are sent from the Vindale Vampires Courts to collect Blood for the Blood Bath on Saturday Night. The Blood Golems are hunting for fresh blood to drain from people. Each Killing Blow is a “unit” of blood for them, once they get 5 Killing Blows they will retreat to the Courts. This is part of a greater plot connected to another area around Elysia.

Unhallowed: A cavern was discovered after a merchant was taken from the town square by a creature with a bloody face. The Eye Slitters live in a large cavern a short distance from the city of Vindale. These creatures cannot see, they are completely blind and live solely by sound. If you disturb them they will attack with unrelenting fury. If you are quiet and don’t make a Sound they will ignore your presence. The merchant is laying in the corner of a cavern opening bloody and hurt with a withered leg, forcing someone to help carry him and not be able to fight. The encounter can be defeated VERY carefully with stealth and getting the Merchant and his chest out OR they can trigger the Eye Slitters and risk fighting them all. The lighting will be very Low in the cave and the Eye Slitters will be roaming the Cavern looking for intruders.

Contagion: A letter is delivered that a sickly looking man is wandering the streets of Vindale coughing up some kind of “Green Bile” A location will be given in the letter where he is staying for the evening, upon arrival the adventurers see a large man cooked in robes. They begin to talk to him and he begins coughing up a “Green Bile” when the adventurers advance to attack him, the man explodes into a swarm of Dire Chaos Rats, killing the wanderer. From his robes and cloak, come a Swarm of Dire Chaos Rats (Dracula turning into swarm of rats effect) 

Soulless Existence: The Clocktower in Vindale is under attack by large clockwork golems. Something in the clocktower seems to be drawing them to the place but it is unclear what until they are dealt with. Inside is an agent outside of time the Golems were hunting, he has on him a book in a language that isn’t native to Elysia. The book is what is drawing the Golems towards it. The book reads as Time Magic but when you can read the words in translation, it was written in a Void language. The Golem want the book to be destroyed, the Agent wants to escape after stealing it from the Vindale Vampire Library. It’s up to the Adventurers who gets to keep the book or if it is destroyed. The Void language in the book is for a summoning ritual of Void creatures. 

To a Breathless Oblivion: Locked away in a stone crypt, a layer of red vines wrapping across the door, sleeps a family crypt of restless angry spirits who are bound here and seek release but have been driven mad by the visions they have seen for 20 years. Their physical bodies are perfectly preserved in their sarcophagus but their faces are frozen with anguish and horror. From their bodies rise Wraiths of pure Madness, these spirits want others to be driven to Oblivion aswell and will not rest until slaughtered. These are mercy killings, once the Wraith is defeated from each body, they will return the essence to the corpse and the decay will instantly appear, the soul will pass on freely now to the other side and a reward of treasure will be where the final Wraith was slain.
