schedule: saturday early afternoon
weight: 
plotline: Contagion
requirements: Ran directly after "A Plague is Born"

description: When the adventurers leave the storehouse in A Plague is Born, they can hear screams coming from the inn next door. They can choose to investigate or not.
 
synopsis: |
  The Dire Chaos Rats have escaped and have invaded the inn next door to the storehouse. Screams of the patrons can be heard as soon as the adventurers exit the storehouse. This is round two with the rats.

  If a Rat downs a PC, they will infect them on the count of "I infect you one, I infect you two, I infect you three." The PC will then become Infected (see running notes). There should be approximately 30 Dire Chaos Rat spawns. These rats, unlike their just born counterparts, will target, attack, and infect every adventurer they can.

  If Velray Fisttoe is used, he will be screaming for help when the adventurers exit the storehouse, and will thank the adventurers profusely after they clear out the rats from their inn.
    
outcomes: 
  - The PCs go for round two with the rats
  - The PCs choose to ignore the screams and the rats decimate the inn ("The Plague is Upon You" can be ran)

running_notes: 1.As soon as the PCs exit the mod shack in "A Plague is Born", inform them that they can hear panicked screaming coming from the inn directly next door, ask what they do. 2.Infection, Some creatures have the ability to infect helpless victims with material that will turn the person into a version of the creature. Unlike a werewolf or vampire curse, this is only a physical transformation of the victim’s body. Players will be told of specific triggers if necessary. Victims will lose all memory of their former lives, and the player must follow the commands they are given by the Monster Master until the character is slain. The character may then be killed and then given a Life spell and be cured of the infection. If the player dies the spirit may then proceed to the Healers’ Guild to be resurrected as normal. Infection is done just as a Killing Blow, with a count of “I infect you 1, I infect you 2, I infect you 3.”
