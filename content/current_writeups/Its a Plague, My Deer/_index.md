description: A black deer with glowing green antlers delivers a message telling the players of a tainted well(the source of the Contagion). The players must purify the well. 

synopsis: |
  
  A black deer with glowing green antlers comes to the town. It isn't there to attack anyone or anything of the sort. It's there to get people to follow it. It is under instruction from On Brighthelm, the beastmaster responsible for the rats and the sickness running through the town, to go to town and retrieve as many people as possible.  
  
  When the deer brings the people back to the large spring, the deer runs away. They find a large spring lit green in the night. In the center of the spring, out of reach, is a treasure chest. This chest has a hook on the top of it. If anyone steps in this pool at anytime, they take 100 Elemental Chaos per second. 
  
  The spring is incredibly toxic (green ropelight is turned on) and needs to be purified. Purification is a two part process. 
  
  - **Purify Well Cantrip**: must be cast upon the well.
  - **Pour a potion into the well**: to complete the process. The potion is in a puzzle box in the center of the circle. Laying around the pool are pieces of PVC. One has a hook on the end. The PCs must put together the hook, get the chest, open the puzzle, pour the potion into the pool, 
    
  When the PCs cast purify well or pour the potion into it, it will change the ropelight color to blue. When the last step is done, the rope light color will change to yellow/white, then go off. The well is then purified. The spring in town must be purified, and the plague will go away. 
  
outcomes: 
  - The PCs purify the well, get attacked
  - The PCs don't purify the well, the plague continues

has been spotted near the town. It acts like it wants someone to follow it. When followed, the deer leads them right to the source of the plague.
