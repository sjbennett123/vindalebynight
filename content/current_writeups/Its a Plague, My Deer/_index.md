description: A black deer with glowing purple antlers has been spotted near the town. It acts like it wants someone to follow it. When followed, the deer leads them right to the source of the plague.

synopsis: >
  Scene set up- There is an unreasonably large circle of lit rope lights. This circle represents the noxious cloud over the spring. In the center of the circle is a bucket. There is a line on the bucket indicating how much 'potion' needs to be delivered into the center of the spring. There is a smoke bomb behind the bucket. 
  
  There is a possibility for mod failure.
  
  A black deer with glowing purple antlers comes to the town. It isn't there to attack anyone, but to deliver a message and the spring antidote from On Brighthelm. It's also there to get people to follow it back to the well. 

  The message reads- 
  
  Greetings! My animal friend here has told me of your troubles with the spring in Vindale. I have been able to reverse engineer the taint on the spring and have brewed an antidote which, along with a purify well cantrip, will hopefully rid the spring from the taint, and hopefully anyone that was unfortunate enough to drink from it. Read carefully, it is very important that the steps be done in order for the antidote to work. 
  First, the air around the spring is extremely toxic and will kill you in seconds. Keep this in mind while trying to pour the antidote. Second, the antidote must be poured into the very center of the spring for it to be effective. You must get as much as possible into the spring. I don't know how much you need exactly, so I am sending as much as I could make. Please be careful with it. I do not know the effects if drank or gotten on skin. Third, a purify well cantrip MUST be cast on the well after the antidote in order to complete the cleansing. If not, I'm afraid the taint will regrow like algae. After it's done, the water should be safe to drink both here and the spring in town. If this antidote does not work, or if you fail, please send word with my most trusted messenger here, and I will get to work on the problem straight away. 
  All we have is Tyrra,
  Feihlen Brighthelm
  
  When the deer brings the people back to the large spring, the deer runs away. They find a large spring ringed in blue light. The very air is repugnant and if you cross the light you will take 100 Elemental Chaos per second. The spring is incredibly toxic and needs to be purified. It is a two part process, one is the PCs have to pour the potion given by the deer into the well, and the second is an actual purify well cantrip to complete the process. 
  
  Laying around the pool are pieces of PVC. One has a cup at the end. The PCs are meant to put together the pole and carefully pour the potion into the pool's center (into a bucket with a line indicating minimum amount of potion needed), and then cast purify well onto the spring. If the PCs are successful, the lights will go off.
   
  
outcomes: 
  - The PCs purify the well, get attacked
