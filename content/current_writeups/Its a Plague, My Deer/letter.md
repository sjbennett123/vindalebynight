  Greetings! My animal friend here has told me of your troubles with the spring in Vindale. I have been able to reverse engineer the taint on the spring and have brewed an antidote which, along with a purify well cantrip, will hopefully rid the spring from the taint, and hopefully anyone that was unfortunate enough to drink from it. Read carefully, it is very important that the steps be done in order for the antidote to work. 
  First, the air around the spring is extremely toxic and will kill you in seconds. Keep this in mind while trying to pour the antidote. Second, the antidote must be poured into the very center of the spring for it to be effective. You must get as much as possible into the spring. I don't know how much you need exactly, so I am sending as much as I could make. Please be careful with it. I do not know the effects if drank or gotten on skin. Third, a purify well cantrip MUST be cast on the well after the antidote in order to complete the cleansing. If not, I'm afraid the taint will regrow like algae. After it's done, the water should be safe to drink both here and the spring in town. If this antidote does not work, or if you fail, please send word with my most trusted messenger here, and I will get to work on the problem straight away. 
  All we have is Tyrra,
  Feihlen Brighthelm
