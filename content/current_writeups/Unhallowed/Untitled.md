Unhallowed: A cavern was discovered after a merchant was taken from the town square by a creature with a bloody face. The Eye Slitters live in a large cavern a short distance from the city of Vindale. These creatures cannot see, they are completely blind and live solely by sound. If you disturb them they will attack with unrelenting fury. If you are quiet and donâ€™t make a Sound they will ignore your presence. The merchant is laying in the corner of a cavern opening bloody and hurt with a withered leg, forcing someone to help carry him and not be able to fight. The encounter can be defeated VERY carefully with stealth and getting the Merchant and his chest out OR they can trigger the Eye Slitters and risk fighting them all. The lighting will be very Low in the cave and the Eye Slitters will be roaming the Cavern looking for intruders.
