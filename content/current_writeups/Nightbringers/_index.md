requirements: A Horrible Night to Have a Curse has been ran

description: A local family has been given a cursed object by a shady merchant, they were told once a day it would produce a magnificent feast.
synopsis: It produces a “feast” but the feast is not very human consumable friendly, the feast is just 3 vials of blood. A wizard dressed in grey and blue offered the family help, they put a Circle of Power infront of their front door to keep the hordes back. Vampire Underlings have been mindlessly spawning and charging the front door of this stone house trying to make it inside. The Circle of Power “barrier” powers up for 1 minute and then down for one minute. Behind the “barrier” is a physical switch the PCs must engage to deactivate the “mechanism” to stop the swarm. However, the “barrier must power down through 5 cycles to unlock the door. When the door is unlocked and opened the Hordes seem to stop, but when the door is closed after sundown the Vampires spawn endlessly and assault the house.
outcomes: 
  - The PCs survive the 5-Cycle onslaught and gain entry to the Citizens house. They may destroy the cursed object and end the assaults, or they may take the curse item and Vampire Thralls will spawn and hunt them for it for the weekend.
  - The PCs fail to survive the 5-Cycle onslaught and the family is slaughtered at dawn by the Vampire Thralls for the Cursed Object.
