**Descriptive Phrase**: Properly Repped


**Roleplay Notes**

- The “wizard” in Grey and Blue never said his name but he was very convincing.

- The “wizard” said he was given this object from a strange man wearing a silver spiraled mask and glowing eyes

- You spent 30 Gold on this Curse Object. You would be willing to sell it if anyone wants if, but you don’t want to keep it either way.

- If no one wants to buy the Curse Object then request it to be destroyed. If someone wants to buy the Curse Object, then offer 15 Gold as the price. Beg to get at least 10 Gold if they haggle you hard on the price.
