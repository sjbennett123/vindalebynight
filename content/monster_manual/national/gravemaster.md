Add lvl 20th Floor Fighter/Rogue/Scholar/Templar on top

Add 40 Body (140 Total)

Add +4 to Weapon Damage (1h 10, 2h 15)

No Respawns in the Mausoleum. Once you are dead you are dead unless the other NPCS can bring you back using their skills if intelligent enough to do so

Don’t SPAM attack your Magic Death! Think of how the fairness of the module is going and who they have on it.
