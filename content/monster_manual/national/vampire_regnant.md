**No Respawns in the Mausoleum. Once you are dead you are dead unless the other NPCS can bring you back using their skills if intelligent enough to do so**

**Don’t SPAM attack your Arcane Vampire Charm!** Think of how the fairness of the module is going and who they have on it. 

**USE CARRIER BASED ON GROUP TYPE NORMAL/NAUSEA/DRAIN LIFE**
