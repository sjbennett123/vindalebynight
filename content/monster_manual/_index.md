If there is something that you are not using don't populate it the system will handle it. 

Often there are bits where the cast need to add their own little something to a role. Give some guidance for this so that they can be more confident in their play.

Try to give the cast some guidance on making the characters come alive. What do you say exactly how do you say it. What mannerisms will make the characters work. 

Remember to give your characters names. Use name lists such as the [Storygames Name Project](http://eakett.ca/sgnp/)
