- Sell the pitch that the Speaker of the Children of the Stars is giving and refute anything negative the PCs say about them.

- NOTHING SEEMS OUT OF PLACE TO YOU!!!! The Kool-Aid is strong with the Children of the Stars and tastes amazing.

- Ask the adventurers where they have been for the last 3 years!

- Talk about how weak the current Duke Thermo is! Duke Ryldinmar would never have let this happen on his watch!
