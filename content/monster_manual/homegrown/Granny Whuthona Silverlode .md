title: Grandmother “Granny” Whuthona Silverlode

description: Old (190), tottering dwarf lady
Layout: role

introduction: > 
  “Oh dear! Look at you! What a lovely sweater! Are you hungry? Thirsty? Need a healing? Granny's here to help!” At the tender young age of 190, Granny is a lovely, squat, old figure in the local community. She has never met a stranger, and welcomes all who come to her door! When the occupation happened, Granny kept her head down and did as she was told. She allowed her neighbors to “teach Huldrek a lesson”, even though it hurt her to know what he had to go through. He was bound to be caught by the Bloody Fist and killed, and possibly Granny Whuthona along with him. 
  
  
  Today, Granny occupies her time crocheting, baking, making concoctions and potions, and healing the occasional accident or illness. All and all, her life is simple and fulfilled.
motivation: She wants her recipe book back. And she wants someone to find her grandson Huldrek, but she is more worried about her book. She is willing to share information to achieve those goals. She is kind and wants to help where she can. She will use her healing abilities if needed.
movement: Shuffled, stooped gate. Slow. Movement should look like it's hard to do [like an old person]. 
speech: Soft spoken and intelligent, with a hint of anxiety.
