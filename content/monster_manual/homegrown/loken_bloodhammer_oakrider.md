title: Loken “Bloodhammer” Oakrider 
description: You aren't sure why you were pulled to this Timeline exactly of Stonewood but it is safe to assume the Hoylean-Murumbrian War that has been raging is the source. In your original timeline of Stonewood, you were a hero of the people, pure of heart and devout in your bloodlust of killing Orcs and the Underdark. Something is off about the leader of the Bloody Fist in this timeline but not Time related just off from when you faced the one you did before Time was broken in alternate Elysia. You will warn them of the hellish war that is coming and teach them how to survive.

introduction: Loken “Bloodhammer” Oakrider, a displaced hero from another timeline of Stonewood who slew their Warlord in an honor duel, re-emerges in Stonewood now due to the timeline being broken with Stonewood via Hoylean and Murumbrian invasion. Loken has an affinity for Time Magic but he is primarily a warrior. His visage is one of the faces in the Stonewood Mausoleum of Fallen Heroes. There was a Loken Oakrider of old in the beginning of Stonewood but he has been long dead. The original Loken was a hero of a war with the Underdark. Seeing how he could fit in this timeline and help the people of Stonewood since this is his ancestral land, he has assumed the ID of Loken Oakrider as the “reborn” hero.
