You lead the ranks of the Bloody Fist grunts and scouts with terrifying vigor. Your word is law to the lower ranks, they will die on your command. Every battle you win is another reward closer to a promotion to Honor Guard. The Generals and Warlord rely on your tenacity and tactics to win the war against Woodhaven.

You have been corrupted by the Murumbrian invasion of the Ritual of Fire. They have blessed you with non-corporeal Form as you became closer to Darkness. Hunt and fight any non Murumbrian you see, your mind has been overwhelmed with The Dark Ones power and now you will fight for Murumbria until the hour is over.

When you die: you will revive/renew every 10 minutes like the Murumbrians do. When you are up, just hunt PCs and fight them, you arenâ€™t trying to capture the Chosen One, but your mind has been overwhelmed with The Dark Ones power and now you will fight for Murumbria till the 1HR is over.
