You have been corrupted by the Murumbrian invasion of the Ritual of Fire. They have blessed you with non-corporeal Form as you became closer to Darkness. Hunt and fight any non Murumbrian you see, your mind has been overwhelmed with The Dark Ones power and now you fight for Murumbria until the hour is over.
