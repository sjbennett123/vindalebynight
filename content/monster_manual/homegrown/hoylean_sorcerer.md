introduction: You were once a proud high Dwarven sorcerer of Hoyle before its last destruction. The war in Murumbria has been raging for years out of the sight of this realm, but you have been perfecting your arts for what is to come. You were lured in by avarice when an auction of Magic Items was being hosted near Hoyle. When you arrived, it was an ambush by the Bloody Fist. Now by the Ritual of the Changed Ones, you are under their command, soldiers in a different war now but solider none the less. You enforce the Accords of the Fist upon Stonewood as per your overlords
reset: The Hoylean Sorcerers reform at the altar after 5 minutes have passed and their necklace have powered back up.
movement: Unlike your Murumbrian enemies, you have feet but the flow of time in this transformed state has prevented you from quick movement. You walk at a steady pace and will not increase since time is warped around you. Move robotically.  Make your body turns and head movements slow and robotic while you are patrolling. 
speech: When you are questioned reply with “Move along Citizen, there is Law to be upheld.” When you are engaged in combat reply with “Violators of the Accords shall be subjected to suffering!”

motivation: You patrol and enforce the Accords of the Fist with your every fiber of your being. Nothing is more important than this. You operate like a machine for these laws. It is simple when someone breaks an Accord, you should punish them without mercy and swiftly. They programed your mind like a Golem but left a sentient mind inside albeit transformed into Hoylean Light Zealot, your orders are clear, protect the city and uphold the Accords, maybe one day they will release you from this prison…
tactics: You ignore anyone who is simply wandering around. But you hunt down any violators of the Accords. You will beat them without mercy into the ground and leave them for the Bloody Fist.
