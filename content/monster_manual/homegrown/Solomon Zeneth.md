introduction: You are the last surviving member of Oblivion's Edge, the defenders and curators of the Dark Tower of Moutesque. The Dark Tower serves as a prison for Elysia’s worst villains and spirits that couldn’t be permanently destroyed. Over the last 3 years you have been in a shadow war with a Master Vampire named Demitri Revendreth, one of Valdrick's lieutenants who was trapped in Elysia when the Crystal Barrier went up. Your order has been almost exterminated, but the knowledge of Oblivion’s Edge remains hidden safe from the enemy. You will die to protect the secrets of the tower. Now you have a sign of Hope in the form of Heroes of Elysia who have been summoned to help you rid this Demitri Revendreth from Tyrra
