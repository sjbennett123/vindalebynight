Protect your captives fiercely, the stronger the Lord of the Woods becomes the stronger you become!

Master of Dreams: Anyone in a Sleep effect in your line of sight can be harvested of Dream Energy on a 3 count. This leaves the target with a “Paranoia” effect until the next Sunrise comes to wash away their fears. You are also lethargic as if woken from a Night Terror for the next hour in game (no game mechanic, purely RP). Even if they see the sunrise and get restful sleep they still feel your cold angry caress in their mind for a few days after they have been harvested on.
