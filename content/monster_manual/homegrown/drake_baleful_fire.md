title: Baleful Fire Drake


description: 
Layout: role

introduction: You are a destructive force of Chaos and Flame. You were gifted to the Bloody Fist by the Black Shadow via Ritual to burn their enemies to ashes when conventional means wont work. Stonewood will not burn by normal means but there is nothing your flame cant burn with enough time and rage. The Bloody Fist will issue you orders on who and what to order burn, you will carry out these orders but if the Black Shadow commands your will nothing will change you mind when his majestic commanding voice radiates in your mind

motivation:  Your sole purpose is to burn down any buildings made of Stonewood the Bloody Fist failed to burn before you were summoned. You will kill anyone who gets in your way. You don't chase people down and murder them in cold blood but you will defend yourself and attack when attacked. As long as your contract is completed and buildings are burned your deal with the Black Shadow is complete via the Orcs making a proper sacrifice to summon your power.

tactics:  Stay in a group to make your burning of buildings the most effective. There is strength in numbers. Singled out you aren’t particularly terrifying but as a group of 6 you are mighty. Be imposing and intimidating if people get near you take a defensive stance and roar. Attempt to get the PCs to leave you alone to burn buildings in peace per your contract but they will most likely provoke you with the battlefield chaos going on. If you can't stay together as 6 or some are killed awaiting respawn, move as you can and get to objective points in the camp to set buildings on fire

Special Ability: With a 30 count a Baleful Fire Drake can set a Stonewood build on flame as if it were a normal structure. The Baleful Fire Drake will need to complete a count for each side of the building  to fully engulf. Once a building is complete make a bunch of noise and loudly call out “BURNING COUNT COMPLETE X BUILDING IS ON FIRE!”
