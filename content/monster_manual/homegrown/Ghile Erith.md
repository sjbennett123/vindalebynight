Ghile Erith and Haldin Morse

*You are 2 locals of Cryptinth who went for a walk with plenty of time before Sunset. The Feral choose you as sacrifice to the Alpha. They have already bitten you and it is too late to reverse the Curse of Transformation, but you can learn to live with the Curse in the City Walls.*

**Body**: 10

**Defensives**: None

**Magic**: None

**Weapons**: Dagger

**Damage**: 2 Normal

**Abilities**: Healing Arts, First Aid, Read and Write

**Killing Blow Active**: No

**Transform**: Werewolf lvl 7

**Motivations**: Citizens of Cryptinth who now must come to terms with the reality you are Cursed as Lycans. This isn’t a death sentence for you but it is a heavy weight on your heart…

**Roleplay Notes:** 

·    Ghile Erith takes the news of the Curse rather well and will be ok living with this Curse as most of the town are Lycans. He will try to convince Haldin to live when he begs for death.

o  Say you will be Haldin’s “ward” to help him. Offer to take Haldin under your wing. Tell Haldin his life is worth more than 10g when he offers them to kill him. 

o  BE DISGUSTED WITH THE PCS IF THEY TAKE HALDIN OFFER!!!!!

·    Haldin Morse wants to DIE, he will convince the players to let him die and then slay him so he doesn’t become a Feral. He fears his spirit/soul is too weak to resist the “Call of the Beast”

o  Beg and plead for death, the thought of living with a Werewolf inside terrifies you to your core. You will agree to anything. Offer them 10g if you are killed and not allowed to come back.

o  If they agree to kill you for 10g, BE ESTASTIC!!!!! THANK THEM AND PRAISE THEM CAUSE YOU KNOW THIS IS FOR THE BEST!!!!

·    IF KYUMIRI is involved, he will add a special level of guilt to either choice. If Ghile takes him under his wing, then he could shift and get out of control and kill innocents. If Haldin is allowed to be slain for a “mercy” killing, Kyumiri will put the guilt on them about an untested soul by the Beast and question their judgement. 

o  The final note is ONLY if Kyumiri is INVOLVED if the players fail and he has to rescue them
