title: Werewolves of the Feral

description: Feral Lycan 

Layout: role

introduction: >
  You are the apex predator, the Feral strike fear into the hearts of the weak and strong. Though one by one you might not be as terrifying as other Lycans, your pack tactics and sheer aggression set you apart from your average Lycan. Unlike other Lycans who just mindlessly kill, you go for infection over evisceration. They will still kill if enraged or the target is too persistent about not dying, but they Feral prefer to bit you and let you succumb to the Lunacy of the beast under a Full Moon to join their ranks. While they seem like bloodthirsty savage berserkers, they are quite intelligent in their blood on their hunting. 

  During the day you are a normal person with anger issues, but at night you become a Feral with almost no control over your Transformation unless inside the City Gates of Cryptinth.

motivation: SPREAD LYCANTHROPY!!! The Feral are relentless and terrifying. They inflict their madness on other and see how strong the spirit is to fight off the Lunacy of the Beast. Those who cannot fight off the Beast become Feral, those who fight off the Beast still walk the path of the Lycan and are tested each Full Moon of their spirit. Any undead will be smited where they stand despite your berserk rage, just because you are a mindless berserker doesnâ€™t mean your have the primal urge to fight Undead like all Lycans.
