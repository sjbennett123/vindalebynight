•	You feel the “Silver Import” taxes is unfair if you aren’t part of the Guild. The tax is about 15%
•	You respect the independent trade market and don’t want to belong to anyone.
•	You want to aid the people of Cryptinth with Silver goods to protect themselves where the Guilds will aswell but they will charge more and keep the taxes aswell
•	You love and respect the Lord Reeve, he has helped you out before so you want to help the people in Cryptinth with these increasingly violent attacks
•	You suspect Orden Dutah is not exactly on the up and up but you have no hard evidence yet. You might leave subtle hints to the players that his word is “questionable” at best
•	If the players help you, your payment is 30 gold and access to your wares over the market
