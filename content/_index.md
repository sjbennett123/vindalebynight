## [Current Event]({{< ref "/current_writeups" >}})

## [<i class="fa fa-video"></i> Weekly Writer Check In - Google Hangouts <i class="fa fa-video"></i> ](https://meet.google.com/iak-gnhk-ork?authuser=0&hs=122)

- â†‘ Up there is a link you can click on it! You can also go to [gloryforthefist.netlify.app/writersroom](https://gloryforthefist.netlify.app/writersroom)
- <i class="fa fa-clock"></i> Tuesdays from 8 PM - 9 PM - Starts on time.... Ends on time. <i class="fa fa-clock"></i>
- Follow the writers guidelines available at [gloryforthefist.netlify.app/writing]({{< ref "/writing" >}})
- This is not a place to write from scratch. This is to review and prioritize so that we can write on our own and be coordinated. 
- Use a real webcam if possible. We have loaner webcams you are welcome to. 
- Keep focused on the work don't have distractions up... Discord, Facebook, Facebook Messenger, Netflix, Pornhub, Twitter, Grindr.... <u>it can wait an hour I promise you.</u>
- First we go around and ask what you have been working on and if you need any help.
  - Are you waiting on review for any of your work.
  - What have you worked on in the past week.
  - What are you working on this week.
  - What props do you need.
- Then we talk about modules in depth.
  - Workshop how to improve something.
  - How to solve a problem.
- Sometimes we do a special meeting. 
  - The event just before the event we review the event with our NPC's.
  - The first Check In after an event we do a [Postmortem]({{< ref "/event_postmortem" >}})
  - The second Check In after an event we review our  [Plot Seeds]({{< ref "/plot_seeds" >}}).
- All writeups **must** be completed 2 weeks before the event to be reviewed by another plot team. They will check for Nonstandard effects and consistency. Ideally we would do this sooner than that so that feedback could be incorporated before having copies printed but this is the deadline. 

## [Prop tracking - Trello ](https://trello.com/b/A6eLvFdV/polar-props)

- Make sure your props are on the list and in the order that you need them. 

## [Module Writeups for Feedback - Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/xy8dqwc9ozq9bzuzdh3fy/h?dl=0&rlkey=76lz7t41srkz8zj64oxhe6wud)

- Install the app https://www.dropbox.com/install.  
- Ask to be invited to the Dropbox folder. This will synchronize all of the Writeups and Resources to your computer. 
- This is going to be more than you need,  you are probably only going to look at this months stuff but you might need to read some background that we don't have on the website yet. 
- Don't delete other people's stuff. ðŸ’£ **I'm looking at you Ken Courtney! ðŸ’£**

# NPC Speech

**Take Care of Yourselves:** The most important thing is your health. You are probably not used to this level of activity. 

- **Stretch**: Yes it looks lame. Yes you should still do it. 
- **Drink Water and Eat**: Try to drink a glass of water before you go on a module. 
- **Pace Yourself**: A weekend is a long time. There is no shame in taking a break. 

**Keep a positive energy in the NPC Shack**

- Don't talk about the good old days.
- Don't compare yourself to other running teams.
- Take a break or take a nap. If you can't keep good spirits excuse yourself.

**We are the face of the event. We hold ourselves to a higher standard.** 

- Be respectful to both the players and to the other cast members.
- Don't enable or condone bad behavior. If you see something say something. 
- Focus on the small stuff. Make the small roles sing. Make the ordinary sets special. 
- Be dramatic when playing your roles. Don't phone your performance.

**Tour of NPC Shack**: Everyone is going to need to know the organization of the NPC Shack and help keep it organized. This organization is a work in progress and after the event we should discuss any improvement ideas you have. The stuff here was donated please be considerate and help make it last.

- **Clock**: We have a large clock set up in the shack. If you can please wear a watch.
- **Computer**: This is somone's personal computer. Please be kind to it. All the writeups are on it as well as a local copy of our website. Show that it works to print. 
- **White Head Band**: Have one on your person. If you see a player that does not have one offer to give them one and replace it when you get back to shack. 
- **Pencils**: Carry a golf pencil with you. 
- **Costumes**: When you are done make sure the costume is put away.
- **Belts**: When you are using a tabard wear a belt.
- **Masks**: When you are done using a mask wipe it down so it does not get anyone sick.
- **Packets**: After fights don't mix wet packets back in with the fresh packets. it will cause them to decompose. 

**Secrecy**: You will learn things while running that are intended to be secret from the players. It will also need to be firewalled in your brain from the knowledge you have when you PC. Sometimes you will need to "Play Dumb" when you PC. 

- Some of what you learn will be common knowledge and will be fine to know as your character. If you have any questions speak to an event director and they can help you sort this out.

**Overview of writeups**: This event may be different than many of you are used to, we have a lot more structure and writing than you have probably seen in the past. This might seem stifling, but we hope that we can convince you that can make for great experience for both you and the players.

**Introductions**: Go around in a circle and everyone introduces themselves and states the following. 

- What is your name?
- What about the event they are you excited about?
- What roles do you not want to do? 


**Overview of [Campsite]({{< ref "/camps" >}})**: Map, Module Sites, Dangers

**Rewards**: Thank you for doing this. Giving back like this to enable people to have a fun time is a very generous thing to do. We hope that some baubles and tokens will show our gratitude. 

- **Goblin Stamps**: You get 100 Goblin Stamps per day. 
- **Magic Item Draw**: We will raffle off a magic item. I don't know the specifics of how this works but I guess it comes from the treasure pool.
