- Follow the writers guidelines available at [gloryforthefist.netlify.app/writing]({{< ref "/writing" >}})
- This is not a place to write from scratch. This is to review and prioritize so that we can write on our own and be coordinated. 
- Use a real webcam if possible. We have loaner webcams you are welcome to. 
- Keep focused on the work don't have distractions up... Discord, Facebook, Facebook Messenger, Netflix, Pornhub, Twitter, Grindr.... <u>it can wait an hour I promise you.</u>
- First we go around and ask what you have been working on and if you need any help.
  - Are you waiting on review for any of your work.
  - What have you worked on in the past week.
  - What are you working on this week.
  - What props do you need.
- Then we talk about modules in depth.
  - Workshop how to improve something.
  - How to solve a problem.
- Sometimes we do a special meeting. 
  - The event just before the event we review the event with our NPC's.
  - The first Check In after an event we do a [Postmortem]({{< ref "/event_postmortem" >}})
  - The second Check In after an event we review our  [Plot Seeds]({{< ref "/plot_seeds" >}}).
- All writeups **must** be completed 2 weeks before the event to be reviewed by another plot team. They will check for Nonstandard effects and consistency. Ideally we would do this sooner than that so that feedback could be incorporated before having copies printed but this is the deadline.
