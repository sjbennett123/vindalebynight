## [Current Event]({{< ref "/current_writeups" >}})

## [<i class="fa fa-video"></i> Weekly Writer Check In - Google Hangouts <i class="fa fa-video"></i> ](https://meet.google.com/iak-gnhk-ork?authuser=0&hs=122)

- â†‘ Up there is a link you can click on it! You can also go to [gloryforthefist.netlify.app/writersroom](https://gloryforthefist.netlify.app/writersroom)
- <i class="fa fa-clock"></i> Tuesdays from 8 PM - 9 PM - Starts on time.... Ends on time. <i class="fa fa-clock"></i>
- Follow the writers guidelines available at [gloryforthefist.netlify.app/writing]({{< ref "/writing" >}})
- This is not a place to write from scratch. This is to review and prioritize so that we can write on our own and be coordinated. 
- Use a real webcam if possible. We have loaner webcams you are welcome to. 
- Keep focused on the work don't have distractions up... Discord, Facebook, Facebook Messenger, Netflix, Pornhub, Twitter, Grindr.... <u>it can wait an hour I promise you.</u>
- First we go around and ask what you have been working on and if you need any help.
  - Are you waiting on review for any of your work.
  - What have you worked on in the past week.
  - What are you working on this week.
  - What props do you need.
- Then we talk about modules in depth.
  - Workshop how to improve something.
  - How to solve a problem.
- Sometimes we do a special meeting. 
  - The event just before the event we review the event with our NPC's.
  - The first Check In after an event we do a [Postmortem]({{< ref "/event_postmortem" >}})
  - The second Check In after an event we review our  [Plot Seeds]({{< ref "/plot_seeds" >}}).
- All writeups **must** be completed 2 weeks before the event to be reviewed by another plot team. They will check for Nonstandard effects and consistency. Ideally we would do this sooner than that so that feedback could be incorporated before having copies printed but this is the deadline. 

## [Prop tracking - Trello ](https://trello.com/b/A6eLvFdV/polar-props)

- Make sure your props are on the list and in the order that you need them. 

## [Module Writeups for Feedback - Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/xy8dqwc9ozq9bzuzdh3fy/h?dl=0&rlkey=76lz7t41srkz8zj64oxhe6wud)

- Install the app https://www.dropbox.com/install.  
- Ask to be invited to the Dropbox folder. This will synchronize all of the Writeups and Resources to your computer. 
- This is going to be more than you need,  you are probably only going to look at this months stuff but you might need to read some background that we don't have on the website yet. 
- Don't delete other people's stuff. ðŸ’£ **I'm looking at you Ken Courtney! ðŸ’£**
