# Lets make this website!

## Before we get started

- This is as easy as this process can be but this is NOT a novice process it's technical and intiminating. If you decide this it too much for your needs thank you for your time I can either configure this for you or we can find a tool that works better for you like Squarespace or Wix. 
- We will be using the command line and you will need to take notes. 
- We will go as slow as the slowest person on the call.
- If you have any questions ask and we will talk it through. No need to stay confused. 
  - If you want to go over this again please let me know we can just go through any parts you have had problems with. 


## Configure Local Hugo Instance

- Hugo has steps at https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/ we are not following these steps. We are going to take a slightly different approach
  
- Clone Docsy Example site with github desktop. 
  - https://github.com/google/docsy-example
- confirm it runs locally
  - `hugo server -D`
  - http://localhost:1313/

- create new repository in github as a target
