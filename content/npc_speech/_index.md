**We are the face of the event. We hold ourselves to a higher standard.** 

- Be respectful to both the players and to the other cast members.
- Don't enable or condone bad behavior. If you see something say something. 
- Focus on the small stuff. Make the small roles sing. Make the ordinary sets special. 
- Be dramatic when playing your roles. Don't phone your performance.

**Tour of NPC Shack**: Everyone is going to need to know the organization of the NPC Shack and help keep it organized. This organization is a work in progress and after the event we should discuss any improvement ideas you have. The stuff here was donated please be considerate and help make it last.

- **Packets**: After fights don't mix wet packets back in with the fresh packets. it will cause them to decompose. 

**Secrecy**: You will learn things while running that are intended to be secret from the players. It will also need to be firewalled in your brain from the knowledge you have when you PC. Sometimes you will need to "Play Dumb" when you PC. 

- Some of what you learn will be common knowledge and will be fine to know as your character. If you have any questions speak to an event director and they can help you sort this out.

**Overview of writeups**: This event may be different than many of you are used to, we have a lot more structure and writing than you have probably seen in the past. This might seem stifling, but we hope that we can convince you that can make for great experience for both you and the players.

**Introductions**: Go around in a circle and everyone introduces themselves and states the following. 

- What is your name?

- **Goblin Stamps**: You get 100 Goblin Stamps per day. 
- **Magic Item Draw**: We will raffle off a magic item. I don't know the specifics of how this works but I guess it comes from the treasure pool.
