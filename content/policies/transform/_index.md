## You Have Become a Monster

All transformed characters are subject to Monster card effects like Celestial PVE playtest. Paragon/Greater Race is not considered a “monster” They embody the traits of legendary heroes of their race but suffer the “monster card” effect for Celestial PVE Playtest

## Conditions for Transform Activation
### Plot  Activated

Do not ask Plot to “activate” your transform as modules will be written with them in mind or side Roleplay Spirit Quests will be handled privately.

## Conditions for Transform Deactivation
### Plot Deactivated

On conclusion of module or scene a character's trasnform will deactivate. 

### Ressurection

Your Transform will deactivate if you resurrect. Taking a killing blow or Death Spell does not deactivate your transform. You are still considered transformed until Plot Deactivates them or you take your full 5 minute death count and go to a spirit circle to Resurrect. 

### Player vs Player Combat

PVP is defined as any “Hostile” action causing damage with the intent to kill, render them useless with status effects (taint blood, vertigo gas, nausea, sleep, etc) or knock the target unconscious other than stopping a berserked player. Accidental packet throws hitting other Transformed players is not considered “PVP hostility” as mass melees get messy and unintended targets are hit. If this is a malicious action then it will fall under the “Hostile” category and your Transform will deactivate. 

If there is a situation where you are “assaulted” in game while Transformed and you/they ARE NOT under the effects of a Berserk or Arcane Vampire Charm then call a Hold. If you think someone violated the sportsmanship policy and a Marshall will resolve the situation on the spot.

## 2 Ways to obtain Transforms

### Obtain via Spirit Quest

Spirit Quests are a quest players can request to attune themself with a creature or spirit to grow a bond. Players submit a short write up with the intent of the Spirit Quest and what creature or spirit they wish to attune to and why. 

A player can obtain the Greater(7th) level transform via a Spirit Quest but High(8th) and Master(9th) will need to be cast using a Formal Magic Ritual and Components after you have satisfied your creature or spirit's requirements and trials.

### Cast Using Formal Magic Ritual with Components

This is the ONLY way that a player can attain High and Master level transforms. They may not be obtained with a Spirit Quest. 

#### Transform to Greater Creature

**Level**: 7

**Target**: Spirit

**Duration**: Four years

**Components**: P7, C3, E4, S4, T1 (Unrestricted only)

This formal magic will transform the target into a specific Greater Creature upon the permanent death of the target. It will also leave an affinity of “<Creature> 7” on the target. 

Effects exist which may for limited duration invoke the full transformation prior to permanent death. See the description in the Casting Rules.

#### Transform to High Creature

**Level**: 8

**Target**: Spirit

**Duration**: Four years

**Components**: P8, C4, E5, S5, T3 (Unrestricted only)

This formal magic will transform the target into a specific High Creature upon the permanent death of the target. It will also leave an affinity of “<Creature> 8” on the target. The target must currently have an Affinity “<Creature>7” or higher present upon its spirit. The <creature> must be of the same type of creature as the one being attempted. If the target does not have the correct affinity then this formal magic will fail. All components and scrolls used in the casting of this formal magic MUST be of unrestricted transfer. 

Effects exist which may for limited duration invoke the full transformation prior to permanent death. See the description in the Casting Rules.

#### Transform to Master Creature
**Level**: 9

**Target**: Spirit

**Duration**: Four years

**Components**: P9, C8, E10, S10, T5 (Unrestricted only)

This formal magic will transform the target into a specific Master Creature upon the permanent death of the target. It will also leave an affinity of “<Creature> 9” on the target. The target must currently have an Affinity “<Creature>8” or higher present upon its spirit. The <creature> must be of the same type of creature as the one being attempted. If the target does not have the correct affinity then this formal magic will fail. All components and scrolls used in the casting of this formal magic MUST be of unrestricted transfer. 

Effects exist which may, for limited duration, invoke the full transformation prior to permanent death. See the description in the Casting Rules.

## Abilities Granted by Transformation

### Static Card

Hallucination monsters cannot be specific monsters from the monster database like Troll or Death Knight. They can be described in such a manner as to not confuse the player with other monster types: “Having a thousand tentacles and yellow bile coming out of every orifice,” “Thirty blood red eyes protruding from a tortoise shell and crab legs for feet,” “like an inside-out melon gliding on it’s own puss,” and so on. This effect can take place twice on one game day and lasts for five minutes intervals.  *Incant*: “With the eyes of ancients, I curse you to see the world through a darkened veil.”

The phrase can be up to thirty words of the NPC’s choice (NPC must write it down for the player to use as a cheat sheet). The phrase is keyed off to an event rather that a specific time. You can’t tell the player to say the phrase at 5:30 PM, but you can tell them to say the phrase the first time they see the Regent every day or when the main course of the feast is given to them. Players cannot whisper the phrase, they must say it so at least one person can hear it. The phrase is delivered immediately upon the event that cues the curse. The player only has to say the litany once. *Incant*: “By my wagging tongue, I curse you to say <phrase here and description when>“
- **Lesser Fae Curse**: Remove/Curse of Disgust x3 (Shadow Court Only)-This curse causes the recipient to become disgusted by a given object, person, or action. Each time the cursed individual sees the object of his disgust they must role-play intense disgust and physical discomfort over it. *Incant*: "Since you offend me, I curse you to be offended by the sight of <item>"
- **Lesser Fae Curse**: Remove/Curse of Greed x3 (Neutral Only)This curse causes the recipient to be overcome with greed, they will always claim any treasure for themselves and not be willing to share money or jewelry. They will become covetous of others valuables and may plot to steal them if they so choose. *Incant*: "By the hoard of the miser, I curse you to desire all riches"

**Lesser Fae Curses are intended to force a role-play condition onto a character using the power of the Fae connection via transform.**
