title: "POLAR Disciplinary Policy*"

---

To offer a fair chance to any and all players POLAR’s official disciplinary policy will consist of a four-step process. All four steps will include being spoken to by no less than two members of staff so that you can state your case before a final decision is made.

The first step in this process is a simple conversation. We understand that there can often be misunderstandings. This conversation is put into place so that the staff can hear the player’s perspective of the events and discuss with the player the reason the conversation is being held. 

The second step in the process is a written warning. The player will be spoken to explaining the reason behind the written warning. This written warning will be kept on file for a minimum of 1 year. At the end of that year, the staff will discuss the player and issue(s) for the warning. If the staff feels that player and issue(s) have improved, the written warning will be expunged. 

The third step in the process is a 3 event suspension. After the 3 events, the player may return. It should be noted, however, that just because a player fulfills their 3 event suspension does not mean that any past occurrences are “wiped clean.” Upon returning, the player will still remain under the third portion of this policy in regard to future disciplinary actions. 

The forth step in this process will result in the player being banned from attending further events at POLAR. 

*Please keep in mind that this is a bare minimum base line. At any point, should the staff feel as though a player’s actions are sever enough to warrant harsher disciplinary action(s), up to and including expulsion from POLAR shall be taken. If the actions violate federal, state, or local law, the proper authorities will be notified of the violation(s). POLAR reserves the right to refuse services. If a refusal of service occurs during an event, no refund of money will be provided.*
