Q: Can I use my bird seed packets?

A: No. Bird seed packets are not allowed by our camp site. we are ask that players make packets containing biodegradable airsoft pellets. The packets must still fit into a 35mm film canister and be loosely packed. We recommend 6mm (size) and .12g (weight) and about a 1/2 tbs in each. Player packets will be checked for safety at the events, along with weapon checks.
