title: "Adjudication"
---

Incidents involving only players
Adjudication will be granted if it is found that meta-gaming was involved or if the rulebook was not followed.

Incidents involving plot
Adjudication will be granted on the following grounds.
a) The event director did not follow the direction of the plot review or committee
b) The module director did not follow the direction of the event director
c) The NPCs did not follow the direction of the event or plot director.
Recognize that not following directions does not equate to cheating. Many times people get confused particularly in the middle of intense physical action or they are playing a card with a lot of effects they have never played before.
If it was found that the directions were not followed as a result of deliberate action then marshals will determine additional sanctions.
In-game results of adjudication
When adjudication results, we does not try to take back the results in-game. For example the death occurred in-game but character sheet will not be marked with the death. The items were found by the players in the room when the thief accidentally dropped them and so on
