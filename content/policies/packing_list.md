a non-comprehensive list of things to help you make sure that you're bringing everything that you need for game this weekend.

- **Base Clothes & Weather Clothes** - It's getting down to 43-47 degrees at night, so make sure to pack long sleeve / long legged black pants and shirts, as well as getting up to 70 during the day, so an alternative short sleeve shirt to wear under your costuming.  Bring a hat of some sort for the cold nights.
- **Footwear** - Try to wear boots or non-descript sneakers, but Somerset is notoriously muddy so safety over function.  Bring a few extra pair of socks.
-  **costuming**, including pouches, belts, weapons, shields, packets, cantrip tomes, and a personal light spell.


## Camping/ Sleeping Gear

A set of sleeping clothing, and your toiletries, baby wipes, bug spray, sleeping bag / blankets and a pillow.  Strongly recommend 

- Toothbrush, Toothpaste,
-  Hair Brush, 
- Deodorant, 
- Body Wash
- Towel, Soap & Toilet Paper. 
-  earplugs

**bottled water**.   Somerset ground water is notoriously filthy without additional filtration.

**Snacks**. 

**Sunscreen** if you're sensitive to UV.

**Cash** (this is a Cash-only event)
