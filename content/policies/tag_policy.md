In consideration of the fact that several NERO chapters near the Pittsburgh area have stopped operations (PRO in October 2018 and ARGO in September 2018) and NERO chapters had suspended operations due to COVID-19, the following policy is adopted:

Tags and effects that would expire after October 1, 2018 are being extended to December 31, 2023.  This includes formal magic effects that, by the rulebook, should have a 4-year duration but are marked in the database as "Expires: Never".

POLAR will accept tags that are marked to expire after 10/01/18 and reissue them with an expiration date of 12/31/23.

Since POLAR now covers territory previously covered by PRO and ARGO, POLAR will honor PRO and ARGO LCO tags and effects.

We recognize that many players may have discarded tags that have already expired after 10/01/18, so we will also provide new tags to replace discarded tags.  To make a claim to replace a discarded tag, provide a description of the lost tag and it will be replaced.  For example: "+2 long sword, spirit linked, obtained at ARGO around June 2017".  Remember, NERO operates on the honor system.

Since this is a POLAR local policy and not a NERO national policy, the reprinted tags will need to be marked LCO-POLAR and cannot be used in other chapters.

To prepare these printed tags ahead of the event, please prepare your list of tags (both for those you have in your possession and those you may have discarded) and email to polarlogistics2@gmail.com by 10/17/22.

In addition, for returning players, we will provide "restarting" production tags based on the character skills in order to ensure that the player can use those skills.  For example, a long sword, shield and armor tag for a fighter.

FOLLOW-UP:  The database has been scrubbed to provide the new expiration date for effects that had expired as described above.  Unfortunately, the magic item database deletes expired items so they could not be recovered from the records.

FOLLOW-UP 2: After further consideration, tags will not be re-issued when an existing tag is available.  Instead, the existing tag will be stamped LCO-POLAR with the new expiration date of 12/31/2023.  This will save lots of time and effort.
