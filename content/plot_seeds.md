## Writing 

2-3 sentences. Be specific but leave some blanks. Give enough to spark the imagination!

Go to the background and ground your story in the setting.

Don't be perscriptive. Don't say that it's a new player module or a high level module.

You don't get to write a title. 

Must not be core to a plot. This content may be farmed out to other writers or might not get written at all. 

It can't just be a monster attacks you need more than that.


## Reviewing

Do you see this content actually getting used. 

Does the role need cast ahead of time because of some special rehearsal that is needed. 

Run with it. Don’t just shoot it down
