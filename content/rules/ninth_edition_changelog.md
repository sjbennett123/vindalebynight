## Skill Changes

New Skill:

Barbarian Slay (10 Build) - Can be purchased once for barbarians. Only works as a slay, doesn't work as a parry.

Stop Thrust - The first purchase of this skill is 0 build, and you can purchase an additional stop thrust for 2 build for every 2 proficiencies you have.

One Handed Block - Is now a skill that costs 0 build. Acts the same way as the playtest, but somewhat awkward implementation.

Hobling Dodge - Raised to 12 Build

Detect Celestial Magic - No longer packet delivered, after 1 minute of roleplay it acts as a detect magic that only applies to celestial effects.

Alchemy - In order to use contact poison/gasses, you must have sufficient levels of alchemy to make the item you wish to use.

**Dexterity Armor** - Can now be purchased up to 10 times (for 20 points of armor)

**Wear Extra Armor** - Build cost raised to 3/3/4/3

**Weapon Proficiency** - Removed the scaling build structure and profs now cost 15/20/30/18

**Critical Slay/Parry** - Slays now do a flat 100 points of damage. Build cost changed to 10/15/20/13

**Master Proficiency** - Removed the scaling build structure and master profs now cost 17/24/34/22.

**Master Slay/Parry** - Slays now do a flat 100 points of damage. Build cost changed to 13/18/25/15.

**Assassinate/Dodge** - Assassinates now do a flat 100 points of damage.

**Waylay** - Is now a daily skill, lasts 5 minutes and has the same requirements as assassinate (standing behind, see both shoulder blades). Requires a short weapon (or small weapon). Can be parried/dodged/resisted as a physical attack. Build cost is 6/3/6/6, and you may only purchase additional uses once for every 5 levels your character attains.

**Herbal Lore** - Now detects and identifies a substance in food or drink in 3 seconds, and can be used to destroy said substance in 1 minute of roleplay (so that the food/drink is safe).

**Smithing** - Changed the number of levels required for silvering a weapon, removed flawless refit, now costs 3/4/4/4.

**Formal Magic** - Now costs 12/8/4/6 for primary school and 24/16/8/10 for secondary school.

**Armor** - Armor no longer breeches. Max armor (sum of physical, arcane, and dex armor) is now 10 points for a scholar, 15 points for templars and rogues, and 20 points for fighters. Anyone can purchase wear extra armor up to a max of 40 points. Good costume now counts as an extra rank of wear extra armor that doesn't count towards the total limit (so you can conceivably have 45 points with good costume and max ranks of Wear Extra Armor). 

**Effect Delivery** - The mechanics for delivery of effects in combat has been streamlined to be more intuitive. Please refer to table 6-2 in the rulebook for more information (page 89). 

**Unconsciousness** - When you are unconscious (0 body), you come back to 1 body after 1 minute, not 10 minutes. 

**Resurrection** - Is only 5 minutes, and you come to life with clothes on. 

Packet delivered Physical - Can now be parried. 

Laugh and Dominate Effects - Removed (Dominate changed to Charm) 

Spirits and Dismemberment - You can no longer detect a spirit in a body. Players can no longer cut off body parts to have them lifed - it's the whole body or nothing. As explained to me, dismemberment occurs IG, but simply never happens to PCs because of the lack of a way to rep it. 

"Lesser" - Plot teams now have the option to tack the word "Lesser" onto any delivered effect. This changes the duration of said effect to 10 seconds. Intended to allow heavy use of effects without depleting player resources. 

Weapons - No longer require open cell on the pommel of the weapon. Ultralights added to the weapon construction information. 

Crafting - Players with production skills can now produce 3-4x their levels in production under the correct circumstances. Here's how it works. 

All players receive their skill level in production levels

If you utilize a workshop, you receive production levels equal to your skill level

If you are a master (at least 10 levels), you receive additional production levels equal to your skill level.

You can supplement your production with refined minerals by supplying production components or silver per production level (maximum levels equal to your skill level).

Archery - Now uses yellow packets instead of streamers. 

Physical Pin/Bind/Web/Confine -or- Entangle - You can no longer cut free from Physical Pin/Bind/Web/Confine, nor can it be removed with dispel magic. If you were using the Physical Attacks Playtest, Entangle has been removed from the game. The only valid form of escape for Physical Pin/Bind/Web/Confine is the Remove Physical Affliction spell (or Endow/Delayed Endow for Physical Pin). 

Rip from Pin/Bind/Web/Confine - Characters no longer take damage from Ripping free (unless specified on the card). 

Charm Effects - Charm effects now have a strength associated with them. If you are under a charm effect and are hit by a lower strength charm effect, you do not take the effect. If you are hit with a charm of equal or higher strength, it replaces the lower strength effect.

·     Calm

·     Shun

·     Charm

·     Fear

·     Control

·     Vampire Charm

·     Enslavement

Targeted Effects - Targeted effects have changed significantly from the way they worked in 8th edition. If you are hit with a targeted effect (such as wither, shatter, or destroy), you cannot assign it to an item/location that would take no effect from the attack. For example, if someone hit you with a "Magic Wither Arm" and your left arm was already withered, you'd have to take the effect on your right arm. If you were hit with a "magic destroy weapon" effect, you would have to take it on a non-rendered item. If there is no legal target (or the only legal targets are withered/rendered), do not call "No Effect." If delivered by a carrier attack, you will still take the damage associated with the attack. 

## Race Changes

**Barbarians** - Can now purchase Barbarian Slay for 10 Build. Detect Celestial magic changed to a 1 minute focus instead of packet delivery.

**Hoblings** - Dodge is now 12 build.

**Mystic Wood Elves** - Prepare Hearth and Manifold added to the list of skills that count as "Craftsman" Skills.

**Sarr** - Can now purchase Waylay. Scenting Ability reduced to 3 seconds (was 1 minute).

**Scavenger** - Scenting Ability reduced to 3 seconds (was 1 minute). Now specified that you must like a mundane animal, not a magical animal (no Drake, Griffin, or Unicorn scavengers). Scavengers are no longer required to not understand currency or be savage beasts.

## Cantrip Changes

**Invoked** - All invoked cantrips now have 3 5 uses, regardless of the number of formal levels a player possesses. 

**Cantrip** **Tomes** - No longer require a 10g book to create. Just need an untagged book that's at least 6" x 4". 

#### General Cantrips 

**Channeling** - Reduced to 1 component. 

**Imbue** - You must now choose the spell at the time of casting for reversible spells or Eldritch Blast. 

#### Earth Cantrips 

**Field Resurrection/Abjuration** - Removed 

**Healing Pool** - Now provides a flat 150 points of healing, regardless of the number of formal levels a player possesses. 

**Tyrra's Claw** - Now provides either a shortsword or long sword phys-rep on the first casting. Casting a second time gives you a shortsword (so you could be fighting long sword/shortsword or shortsword/shortsword). Can be combined with Etherial Sword. 

### Celestial Cantrips 

**Boltstorm** - You can now speak, bringing this spell in line with Bane the Dead/Boon the Dead. 

**Element's Fury** - Reduced to 1 component. Now provides a flat 150 points of damage, regardless of the number of formal levels a player possesses. 

**Etherial Sword** - Now provides either a shortsword or long sword phys-rep on the first casting If cast a second time, you can now fight with a long sword and a shortsword, instead of two claws. Can be combined with Tyrra's Claw. 

**Lore** - Now identifies up to 2 items, regardless of the number of formal levels a player possesses. 

**Magic Key** - Removed 

## Formal Changes

**Formal Casting** - All formal magic casting is now done in a fishtail rep, which no longer requires casting the 9th level Circle of Power spell. These reps must contain runes, symbols or pictures to function correctly. 

**Obliterate** - Cannot be contested to 1 hour (wording is strange, is this true?).

**Greater Ward** - Removed

Cloak and Bane - Clarified the various types of cloaks and banes.

Create Protective Circle of Power, Create Extended Circle of Power - Neither of these formals require that a Circle of Power be cast first. In addition, the max size of the circle is based on the number of formal levels the caster possesses (2 foot radius per level, max of 40 foot radius).

Transform - Now is permanent and doesn't exist on the spirit as an effect. Still requires the previous transforms in order to cast the next level.

Spirit - A person's spirit now counts as an item for the sake of the magic item slots variant. Therefore, you can have 5 items or 4 items and spirit effects.

## Production Changes

General Production - Production no longer uses production points, but instead uses production levels. It doesn't really affect the amount of production someone can make. Production is also for the most part free. Every day, you get one production level per level in the skill, you can get one production level per level of the skill if you use a workshop, and you can get an additional production level per level of the skill for one silver per level. Finally, if you're a master (at least 10 levels), you get an additional production level per level of the skill. Confusing, but in essence you can get up to 4 times the level of the skill in production levels per day.

#### Alchemy

·     **Laughing Posion** - Removed from the game.

·     **Love and Love 9** - Removed from the game.

·     **Forget-Me-Not, Forget-It-Well** - No longer uses a phrase, as the target simply forgets the set amount of time. Can receive a purify blood in 10 minutes to remember. If you dissipate before the 10 minutes is up, the Forget effect fails and the character remembers everything.

·     Durations - Durations changed to match spell durations (Liquid Light is 5 days, most effects are 5 minutes).
