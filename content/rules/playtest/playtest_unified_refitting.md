**Objective**: Currently it requires sixty seconds to refit your physical armour (roleplaying tightening straps, repositioning plates), sixty seconds to refit your dexterity armor (roleplaying stretching and/or shaking out tightened muscles), and an additional sixty seconds to refit your arcane armor
(roleplaying concentrating). The objective of this playtest is to unify the refitting process of physical armor, dexterity armor, and arcane armor into one sixty second count.

**Summary**: Under this playtest, players will be able to refit all their worn armor at the same time, allocating a equivalent portion of the roleplaying time to each type. For example, if a player was wearing both physical and dexterity armor, they would spend thirty seconds roleplaying the tightening of straps, etc and then start stretching for the remaining period of the thirty seconds. All other rules for refitting each individual type of armor must be met (must be able to move for Dexterity, no use of other in game skills, no walking around while refitting your physical armor, etc).
