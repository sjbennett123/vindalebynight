**Objective**: The objective of this playtest is to promote use of Celestial damage spells over use of other magics on monsters and PCs with augmented stat cards.

**Summary**: Any monster (as defined by a character not made entirely skills purchased via the Rulebook) or any character with an activated transform or in a golem will be affected by the Monster Special Vulnerability (p.92 of the Rulebook) Double Damage from <Celestial>. This playtest stacks with that of the Base 10 Celestial playtest. The damage called at the end of the spell the current base damage, either Base 5 or Base 10 with the Base 10 Celestial playtest, not the doubled damage. For reference the affected Celestial spells are:
