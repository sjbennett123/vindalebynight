**Updated**:  April 17, 2018

**Version**: v1.0

**Authors**: Ian Petley, Jerry Boyd and Nick Denny

**Approved By**: Joseph Valenti

**Objective**:
To cut down on the tag requires of PCs in order to use Archery.

**Summary**: 
In order to use a Bow/Crossbow, arrow/bolt tags are no longer required. As this is a playtest and not a rules change, arrows/bolts tags may still be used, however now give the weapon +1 damage when used.
Note:	The number of arrow packets on you at the start of a module is the max number of arrows you can use during that module regardless if you have tags or not. This playtest does not grant archers unlimited arrows.
