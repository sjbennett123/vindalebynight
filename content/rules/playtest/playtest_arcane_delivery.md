**Summary**: The following changes to the Arcane delivery type are as follows:
P.87 of the Rulebook under Effect Types:
Arcane: Effects delivered this way are created from raw energies. They are not blocked by any defenses. The same casting rules apply as spells except you do not need the ability to speak.
P.88 of the Rulebook Table 6-1:
Remove the checkmarks from the columns Dodge, Displacement & Phase, Resist and Effect Shield, and Cloak & Bane for the Packet: Arcane rows.
P.90 of the Rulebook under Packet Attacks:
Arcane <spell name or effect>
Effects delivered as arcane will ignore and not expend a Displacement, Guardian of the Four, Shield Magic or Reflect Magic spell. These effects are removed by a Dispel Magic.
