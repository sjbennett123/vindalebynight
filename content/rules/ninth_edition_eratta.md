### Focus Errata

Add the following on page 46 under the Spell Disruption heading:

"There are two ways to prevent a spell that you're casting from being disrupted.

The most common method is by wearing armor and protective spells such as bless and shield. An attack must deal damage to your body points in order to disrupt a spell, so if your collective armor and protective points absorb the damage then the spell is still completed. To indicate this, you must call, "Armor,"immediately after completing the verbal that would have been disrupted.

The other method to prevent disruption is the focus special ability (see page 92.) To indicate that you used focus, you must call, "Focus," immediately after completing the verbal that would have been disrupted."

### Target Specific and Sub-Targets

Add the following after the second sentence of the entry for Target Specific on page 47:

“If right or left is not specified for a wither limb, the target may specify either un-withered limb. If the target possesses multiple destructible items that fit the criteria of a shatter or destroy’s sub-target, they may choose which item to affect. A player may never choose an already withered limb as the sub-target of a wither limb effect, and may never choose an indestructible object as the sub-target of a shatter or destroy effect, even if a sub-target is specified by the attacker."

### Area Effect Errata

Add the following entry under Delivery Methods on page 87:

“Area Effect

This delivery method is used only for traps and hazards or environmental effects. An in-game PC or NPC may not use area effect as a delivery method for attacks or abilities. Area effects are usually be announced by an out-of-game player wearing a white headband (typically the staff member who is monitoring the encounter.) An active NPC may call area effects, but this should only be done if an out of game encounter marshal is not available. Area effects are blocked by any defense that would work against the attack's effect or type except for displacement, parry, dodge and phase.

By default, a hazard or environment area effect hits everyone who hears the verbal. The event staff may specify other uses of area effects that have more specific targets or trigger conditions. If so, the call is the same but person announcing the effect must indicate the target first. 

The verbal call for an area effect that delivers elemental, physical or poison damage is "Area Effect <number> <effect type> <damage type>."

For example: The adventurers travel to the Elemental Plane of Fire. Every 60 seconds, an encounter marshal in a white headband calls, "Area Effect 10 Elemental Flame."

The verbal call for a hazard or environmental effect that delivers a spell or status effect is, "Area Effect <effect type> <effect name> <target> <spell damage/healing number>."

Example 1: The adventurers find a large stone obelisk. When Arthur the Brave reaches out and touches it, he is shocked by a torrent of arcane electricity. The encounter marshal says, "Arthur - Area Effect Arcane Lightning Storm 30.”

Example 2: The adventurers are traveling through a corrupted forest. Pools of necromantic corruption are represented by sheets of black plastic. The group is pushed back onto a sheet while fighting. The encounter marshal calls, "Everyone standing on a black tarp - Area Effect Magic Wither Limb Leg."

The event staff must declare the presence of any area effect with special targets or conditions before the encounter. The announcement for such effects can be broad enough so that it doesn’t explain how to defeat the challenge. Not all of the announced conditions actually need to be present on the encounter, so that the players don’t know exactly what to expect. The purpose of the announcement is so they know that they might be hit by game effects outside of the normal parameters of weapon and packet combat.

An appropriate announcement would be, “Stepping in certain areas, touching certain objects, performing certain specific actions, possessing specific marks or having specific transformation affinities might trigger area effects on this encounter. If the encounter marshal indicates a specific player or players, only those indicated will take the effect. If no player is indicated beforehand, everyone who hears the call is affected as normal.” ”

### Negating Effects and Carrier Attacks

Remove the last paragraph under the entry for Negating Effects on page 89 and replace it with the following:

"Attacks with a sub-target or option that do not find a valid sub-target are not considered negated. The call is "Got it," and the victim still takes damage in the case of a weapon blow with a carrier attack. For example: A fighter wielding an indestructible shield is hit by “10 Normal Shatter Shield.” He must call “Got it,” and take the damage, even though he does not have a destructibe shield for the shatter effect.”

This is to clarify that defenses from spells, magic items and other sources block the entire attack, not only skills and natural abilities as the original text somewhat indicates.

### Vampire Charm Errata

Add the following at the end of the entry for Vampire Charm on page 92:

"The call for using the gaze form of vampire charm is "vampire charm gaze." This is an out-of-game call that may be used whilesilenced, but anyone who hears the call can recognize that the ability was used. No other effect may be delivered by gaze."

### Quiver Errata

Change the capacity for quivers listed on page 104 to 30. The listings on pages 109 and 110 are correct.

### Applying Contact Poisons Errata

Remove the following sentence from the entry for Alchemy on page 115: "To apply other poisons you need one level of Alchemy.” The entry for “Handle Poison” on page 33 is correct.

### Weakness Errata

Change the duration of the weakness effect to “Indefinite” on page 118.

### Formal Magic and Cantrip Errata

Destroy Magic by Packet or Weapon Attack

The correct verbal call for using the destroy magic formal magic effect as a packet attack or weapon strike is, "<delivery type> Destroy [school] Magic <target>". Unlike other non-spell attacks with a sub-target, this attack must include a sub-target. Since the distinction between the lesser and greater versions of destroy magic applies only to how the effect is used when cast as a formal magic spell, they are not needed when used as a packet or weapon attack.

For example:

"Arcane Destroy Celestial Magic Sword"
 "Magic Destroy Earth Magic Spirit"
 "Spell Strike Destroy Celestial Magic Ward"
