Scott’s Polar Covid Policy

- Nobody within 30 feet of Scott unless both they and Scott are wearing masks.
- Even if you are wearing masks - no hugs, stay a bit separated from each other.
- If Scott must go into a building, the building must have had all windows open during use by others and have had at least 30 minutes to air out before he goes in. If there are not excessive amounts of windows, the air purifier must run in the building for at least 30 minutes.
- If Scott is in a building, he and anyone else who enters that building must wear masks while he is inside or within 30 feet of any openings (windows, vents, doors).
- Anyone who is wearing masks around Scott must ensure that they have a decent seal on them before they go to Scott, and must not take them off for any reason other than severe emergency (think choking, cpr, etc) within 30 feet of him. This includes drinking water, talking on the phone, smoking, using an inhaler (again unless severe emergency), checking makeup, yelling to people who are farther away - do those things 30 feet away.
- If you are feeling AT ALL not well (allergies, a cold you’re sure isn’t covid, etc) DO NOT go within 30 feet of Scott.
- If anyone who was within 30 feet of Scott gets sick within the next 2 weeks they must let Scott know right away.
- Scott will have a lot of different masks that anyone can have. They are free for the taking. Please don’t, like, be wasteful, but please take them.
- Remember that if these rules are broken you are putting his partner’s life at risk.
